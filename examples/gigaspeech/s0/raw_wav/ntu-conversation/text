S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-57819-58185 SO HARBOURFRONT M R T STATION THERE ARE A FEW WAYS TO GO 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-58214-59260 THE FIRST WAY IS OKAY YOU RE~ FROM N T U YOU ALWAYS START FROM #BOON-LAY# MRT STATION SO FROM #BOON-LAY# YOU CAN TAKE TOWARDS TUAS-LINK BUT YOU ALIGHT AT OUTRAM-PARK 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-59445-59880 SO AT OUTRAM-PARK YOU HAVE TO CHANGE TO THE S~ 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-59995-60502 NORTH-EAST-LINE SO FROM NORTH-EAST-LINE YOU TAKE TOWARDS THE DIRECTION OF HARBOUR HARBOURFRONT 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-60512-60655 WHICH ONLY ONE STOP LAH 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-60688-60858 OR YOU CAN GO TO 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-61044-61489 BUONA-VISTA ON THE GREEN LINE ALIGHT OVER THERE THEN YOU CHANGE TO CIRCLE-LINE 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-61511-61888 SO FROM CIRCLE LINE ALSO THE DIRECTION IS TOWARDS HARBOURFRONT YAH 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-62050-62191 UM 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-62935-63169 PH YAH OKAY SO 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-63176-64104 ACTUALLY FOR UH SINGAPORE FOOD SINGAPORE IS KNOWN FOR A FOOD CITY THERE ARE A LOT OF LOCAL FOOD WHERE YOU CAN FIND IN HAWKER CENTRE AND COFFEESHOP 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-64123-64716 SO I WERE I THINK I PERSONALLY WILL RECOMMEND ERM CHICKEN-RICE AND #LAKSA# 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-64728-65284 YOU KNOW THESE TWO OF MY FAVOURITE AND CHICKEN-RICE IS INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN AS ONE OF THE SINGAPORE LOCAL FOOD 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-65549-66777 OKAY SO FOR CHICKEN-RICE RIGHT THERE ARE I THINK THERE ARE THREE MAIN IMPORTANT THINGS TO A CHICKEN-RICE NUMBER ONE IS DEFINITELY THE CHICKEN SO WE HAVE QUITE A FEW VARIATIONS ONE IS WHITE STEAMED CHICKEN ANOTHER ONE IS ROASTED CHICKEN 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-66793-67414 NUMBER THIRD IS SOYA SAUCE CHICKEN AND ONE MORE IS UM IF IS IS LESS COMMON WHICH THE FRIED CHICKEN 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-67424-67813 YAH SO MOST OF SINGAPOREANS EAT ROASTED CHICKEN AND WHITE STEAMED CHICKEN 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-67816-68635 SO IT DEPENDS ON YOUR PREFERENCE FOR WHITE STEAMED CHICKEN IS VERY HEALTH HEALTHIER IS HEALTHIER SO BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY BOIL IT 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-68641-68923 AND THEY'LL I THINK THEY MARINATE IT A BIT 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-68930-70516 BUT FOR ROASTED CHICKEN THERE ARE A LOT PUT A LOT OF SAUCES AND SPICES OKAY THEN THE NEXT THING OF IMPORTANT TO A CHICKEN-RICE IS THE RICE AH IT'S NOT PLAIN WHITE RICE THEY DO A LOT OF I THINK THEY PUT SOME WHAT'S THAT CALLED ER IS IT ER WHAT IS IT CALLED AH LET ME THINK AH 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-70678-71163 I THINK IT'S SOME GARLIC LAH YAH WHEN THEY STEAMED THE RICE SO THAT ADD MORE FLAVOUR TO THE RICE 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-71194-72273 AND LASTLY IS THE CHILI SO THE CHILLI IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THE CHICKEN-RICE BECAUSE IT ADDS VERY SPICE FLAVOR INTO THE RICE AND THE CHICKEN 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-72292-73140 SO IF IF YOU LIKE YOU WANT TO TRY SOMETHING THAT IS UH AUTHENTIC AND LOCAL I THINK THAT CHICKEN-RICE WILL BE BEST FOR YOU 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-73147-73607 THEN IF YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO CAN TAKE SPICY I WOULD RECOMMEND THE #LAKSA# 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-73613-74211 SO LAKSA IS JUST CURRY GRAVY WITH NOODLES AND SOME PRAWNS AND FISH CAKE 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-74252-74367 YAH 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-74629-75187 ERM FOR CHICKEN-RICE YES THERE ARE A LOT OF STALLS SELLING CHICKEN-RICE I MEAN AT OUR 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-75202-76355 HALL OUR OKAY THERE'S A CANTEEN NEAR OUR HALL WHICH CALLED TAMARIND THEY SELL CHICKEN-RICE AND AT SOUTH SPINE WHICH THE N B S SCHOOL THERE'S A #KOUFU# ALSO SELLS CHICKEN-RICE THERE'S A STALL SELLS CHICKEN-RICE 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-76370-76565 FOR LAKSA I THINK 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-76604-77036 ERM I CANNOT REMEMBER ANY STORE SELLING #LAKSA#S AH IN N T U 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-77068-77194 <UNK> UM HM 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-77355-78000 UM YOU CAN GET #LAKSA# AT JURONG-POINT WHICH AT THE #BOON-LAY# M R T STATION NEAR THERE SO THERE'S A FOOD CEN~ COURT 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-78005-78172 YAH AT LEVEL FOUR I THINK 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-78973-79377 OKAY SO WE HAVE CHINESE MALAY AND INDIAN 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-79685-80245 FOR A CHICKEN-RICE UH IT'S CALLED HAINANESE-CHICKEN-RICE IT ORIGINATES FROM HAINAN ISLAND 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-80250-80755 SO IT'S DEFINITELY FROM CHINESE ETH~ ETHNICITY #LAKSA# ALSO 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-80790-81353 YAH FOR IF YOU WANT TO TRY SOMETHING FROM THE MALAY ETHNICITY I THINK I WILL NE~ RECOMMEND #NASI-LEMAK# 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-81388-81700 YAH SO IT'S LIKE ERM 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-81704-82334 IT'S ALSO RICE BUT THE RICE IS DIFFERENT KIND OF FLAVOR SO THEY DO P~ USE PANDAN LEAF TO STEAM THE RICE 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-82343-82834 AND THEY DO HAVE THE REALLY NICE DELICIOUS CHICKEN WINGS AND EGG AND CHILLI 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-82873-83437 THEN FOR INDIAN ETHNICITY I THINK THAT UM MAYBE YOU CAN TRY #ROTI-PRATA# 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-83445-83731 YAH SO IT'S MORE OF A DOUGH 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-83744-84060 THEY USE DOUGH AND FLOUR THEY KIND OF 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-84077-84284 ERM YOU KNOW PIZZA 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-84302-84652 YAH SO IT'S SOMETHING SIMILAR TO PIZZA THE SHAPE 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-84661-84835 BUT THEY DIP IT IN CURRY 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-84862-85336 YAH SO IT'S AND IT'S THERE'S NO OTHER INGREDIENTS PINEA E AND HAM IT'S JUST PLAIN DOUGH 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-85421-85666 AND AND THEY FRY IT ON THE FRYING PAN 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-86114-87819 UM FOR DESSERTS SINGAPORE I THINK ERM OTHER THAN NORMAL ICE CREAM WE DO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE ER #ICE-KACANG# YAH SO IT'S MAINLY ICE WITH COVERED WITH FLAVORFUL COL~ DIFFERENT COLORINGS OF SYRUP 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-87831-88515 AND RED BEAN SO BECAUSE SINGAPORE YOU KNOW IS A TROPICAL COUNTRY IT'S VERY HOT IT;LL BE VERY COOLING TO EAT 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-88518-88833 K~ UM ICE DESSERT AND STUFF LAH YAH 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-89095-89409 ER FOR SINGAPORE DRINKS

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-90094-91148 ICED-#TEH# AND OR ICED-#KOPI# SO WHAT IS ICED-#TEH# OR ICED-#KOPI# OKAY #TEH# IS JUST ACTUALLY TEA IN S~ ENGLISH SO THEY DO HAVE THEY PUT CONDENSED MILK IN TEA 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-91151-91291 AND THEN PUT SOME ICE 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-91297-91962 FOR #KOPI# IS WHAT YOU KNOWN AS COFFEE BUT IT'S DIFFERENT I THINK IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT THE COFFEE IN SINGAPORE 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-91964-92282 BECAUSE THEY USE DIFFERENT COFFEE THE DIFFERENT POWDER 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-92583-92824 THEN FOR THE #MILO# I DON'T THINK YOU 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-92850-92986 WHICH COUNTRY YOU'RE FROM 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-93077-93337 CAMBODIA I DON'T THINK CAMBODIA SELLS #MILO# RIGHT 
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-93356-93748 YAH SO #MILO# IS ACTUALLY AN AUSTRALIAN BRAND SO IT'S SOMETHING LIKE COCOA

S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-04796-04998 BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES SO THAT THAT'S WHY 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-05479-06169 OKAY WHEN I WAS YOUNG LIKE STORYTIME FROM WHEN I WAS YOUNG ERM I WANTED TO BE AN ARCHAEOLOGIST 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-06254-07238 THEN I REALIZE THAT I COULDN'T BE AN ARCHAEOLOGIST IN ARCHAEOLOGIST IN SINGAPORE BECAUSE SINGAPORE I MEAN WHAT CAN I EXCAVATE ANYWAY SO AND THEN I CHOSE TO

S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-20262-20462 I'M TAKING PHILOSOPHY OF FRIENDSHIP 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-20473-20687 TO BE A BETTER FRIEND 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-21097-21345 IT'S REALLY F~ IT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-21354-21927 BECAUSE IT'S RELATABLE TO WHAT YOU DO AND EVEN IF I MEAN IT CONNECTS BACK TO MORAL ETHICS AND 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-21931-22232 ALTHOUGH MORAL ETHICS IS A BIT CONFUSING AH CAUSE I NEVER REALLY TOOK IT 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-22330-22507 THE FACT THAT IT CONNECTS TO 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-22532-23718 THINGS THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND AND UM USED IN REAL LIFE CONTEXTS IT'S INTERESTING AND YAH IT'S IT'S NOT DIFFICULT IN THE SENSE OF MODERN PHILOSOPHY I TRIED TO GO FOR ONE CLASS AND I JUST 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-23774-24268 ZONED OUT BECAUSE SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT UM PERSONAL IDENTITY I DIDNT IDENTITY AND I DIDN'T GET IT 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-24293-24884 YAH BUT IN TERMS OF FRIENDSHIP IT'S IT'S QUITE SIMPLE ERM THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LOVE AND FRIENDS AND LIKE 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-24938-25676 THE FUNGIBILITY PROBLEM AND STUFF LIKE THAT ERM SO IT'S RELATIVELY QUITE SIMPLE AND THE FACT THAT IT ENGAGES 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-25679-25904 A DIFFERENT LIKE PART OF 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-25968-27508 MY STUDY TO WHAT ABOUT WHAT AM I SAYING LIKE A DIFFERENT PART OF MY BRAIN SOMEWHAT TO ACTUALLY LIKE THINK ABOUT THIS SCENARIOS AND COME UP WITH PLAUSIBLE ANSWERS FOR IT IT'S INTERESTING AS COMPARED TO IT'S MORE INTERESTING AS COMPARED TO BIOLOGICAL CAUSE BIOLOGY IS QUITE STRAIGHTFORWARD 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-27520-28370 ERM THE ANSWERS ARE EITHER THERE OR NOT THERE AND IF IT'S NOT THERE JUST TO FIND THE ANSWERS THERE'S BUT IN PHILOSOPHY THERE'S NO STRAIGHT ANSWER TO IT THERE'S ALWAYS ARGUMENTS THERE'S ALWAYS PERCEPTIONS 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-28494-28967 IT'S IT'S MORE ENGAGING TO THE BRAIN RATHER THEN JUST STRAIGHTFORWARD ANSWERS 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-29712-29814 CONCEPTS 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-29844-29955 ERM 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-30077-30314 AH CONCEPTS OH GOD UM 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-30727-30961 UM WAIT LET ME THINK ABOUT IT FIRST UM 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-31485-31672 WELL LIKE I FEEL 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-31700-32004 OKAY THERE'S THIS CONCEPT ON EVERY ARISTOTLE THAT TALKS ABOUT 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-32006-32110 UM 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-32149-32764 ONLY THE GOOD PEOPLE CAN CAN ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THE PERFECT FRIENDSHIP BUT IN GENERAL LIKE I FEEL THAT 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-32796-32969 LIKE ERM 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-32979-33514 PEOPLE WHO HAVE INADEQUACY LIKE UNEQUAL UM BASIS OF VIRTUES THEY 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-33526-33993 CAN GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF FRIENDSHIP IF THE VIRTUES ACTUALLY OVERLAP WITH EACH OTHER 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-34015-34432 AND LIKE THEY COMPLEMENT AND THE WAY THEY COMPLEMENT ACTUALLY UM 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-34486-34904 IT BRINGS BOTH OF THEM INTO HIGHER LEVEL OF THING UH OF CHARACTER 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-34968-35136 SO THAT'S WHY I FEEL THAT 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-35304-36213 THE BASIS OF FRIENDSHIP SHOULDN'T JUST BE BECAUSE THAT OH YOU'RE GOOD AND I'M GOOD SO THEREFORE WE SHOULD BE FRIENDS DOESN'T MEAN LIKE THAT IT SHOULD BE COMPLEMENTARY TO EACH OTHER AND IF 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-36224-36748 TWO PEOPLE ARE ALL GOOD THEN IT DOESNT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY BE FRIENDS BECAUSE 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-36793-37103 THEY WOULDN'T ACTUALLY BRING ADDED VALUE INTO THE FRIENDSHIP 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-37190-38189 SO THAT'S MY OPINION ABOUT THAT AND I THERE'S OTHER THINGS ABOUT PHILOSOPHY BUT I'M I'M NOT GOOD AT IT I'M JUST LIKE LEARNING STUFF BECAUSE I ENJOY IT NOT BECAUSE 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-38201-38532 I I'M VERY GOOD AT IT OR ANYTHING BUT LIKE YAH 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-38948-39737 OH RIGHT NOW I MEAN UH HARMONICS I'M DOING ACAPELLA WITH THE SCHOOL UH WITH N T U HARMONICS SO YAH 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-40200-41386 ACAPELLA IS TO ME IS ONE OF THE TOUGHEST FORM OF SINGING BECAUSE UH I'VE DONE SINGING WHEN I WAS YOUNGER UM FROM WHEN I WAS IN SECONDARY SCHOOL PRIMARY SCHOOL SITI-NUR-HALIZA WE ALL STARTED SOMEWHERE 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-41419-42170 ZIANA-ZAIN OH MY GOSH BUT LIKE UM THOSE WHERE THE DIVAS OF THAT ERA AND STILL A DIVA I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT THAT 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-42206-44113 I CAN'T MATCH UP TO THEM SO I I'M I KIND OF LIKE LEARN MY OWN STYLE OF SINGING AND LIKE I ENJOYED THE ART OF IT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ACTUALLY GOT ME THROUGH POLY ITSELF BECAUSE I WAS IN A SONG COMPOSING CLUB AND WE VENTURED UNDER DIFFERENT GENRES AND EXPERIMENTED WITH MUSIC ORIGINAL MUSIC FROM DIFFERENT GENRES 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-44125-44338 SO LIKE ERM 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-44391-44973 THAT'S WHERE I FIRST STARTED PERFORMING AND STUFF BUT LIKE SOLO SINGING AND ACAPELLA SINGING IS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-45039-45178 ACAPELLA IS 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-45233-45990 TOUGH BECAUSE LIKE STRINGS OF AN INSTRUMENT IF YOU S~ PLAY THE WRONG NOTE IT JUST TURNS INTO A DIFFERENT CHORD AND THEN EVERYTHING GETS THROWN OFF 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-46036-46241 AND THAT THAT'S MY PROBLEM 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-46262-47018 ACTUALLY BEING ROOTED TO A NOTE UH AND ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO SWAY WITH THE NOTE WITHOUT UH GOING A BIT TOO SHARP OF OR TOO FLAT 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-47023-47772 BUT IN GENERAL IT'S BEEN A IT'S BEEN A VERY ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE WITH EVERYONE BECAUSE WE COME FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS OF MUSIC AND DIFFERENT STYLES 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-47790-48349 SO EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN STYLISTIC STYLISTIC INTERPRETATION OF MUSIC AND HOW IT'S SU SED TO BE PRESENTED 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-48372-48562 AND THE WAY 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-48621-49089 THIS MIX HAPPENS IT'S ENRICHING TO MYSELF BECAUSE I GET TO ENJOY 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-49102-49209 DIFFERENT 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-49244-49707 MUSIC FORMS AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT WALKS OF LIFE AND IT'S 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-49727-49855 IT'S SOMETHING THAT 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-49870-50015 UM 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-50049-50514 HAS BEEN FUN AND I DO ENJOY IT AND I DO WISH TO SEE MORE OF IT 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-50587-51123 ALTHOUGH I FEEL THAT LIKE UH WE SHOULDN'T RESTRICT OURSELVES TO JUST POP MUSIC 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-51839-51984 HM SURE 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-52826-53107 I WOU~ I I WOULD SAY IT'S LIKE A SPECIAL KIND OF THING

S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-56416-56963 IT WAS NICE TO GET RECOGNITION FOR THE WORK THAT THE SENIORS DID AND I WOULD THINK THAT 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-56999-57480 THEIR EFFORTS REALLY TRANSPIRED INTO SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY CONCRETE IN TERMS OF 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-57523-58316 GETTING THAT RECOGNITION THAT WE NEED IN OR~ TO GET FUNDS TO TO ACTUALLY DO UP PROGRAMS AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING RUNS SMOOTH 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-58326-58783 BECAUSE IT'S HARD BEING A SOLO C C A WITHOUT ANY BACKING FROM ANY MONETARY FUNDS

S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-82964-84121 I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE IT CAUSE I'VE NEVER REALLY MADE IT MYSELF BUT YOU BASICALLY MAKE IT INTO A HUGE PANCAKE AND THEN YOU COOK IT UNTIL IT'S CRISPY AND THEN YOU FOLD IT INTO A LARGE CYLINDRICAL SHAPE AND YOU SERVE IT WITH 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-84131-84321 UM THREE TYPES OF 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-84336-84589 CUR~ NO I WONT SAY CURRY BUT THREE TYPES OF 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-84654-85137 CURRY PASTE IN SOME WAY THERE'S ONE THAT'S NORMAL CURRY THERE'S ONE ERM WHITE COLOURED 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-85168-85660 PASTY KINDA CURRY THAT IS MORE TOWARDS ERM COCONUT FLAVORED 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-85666-85775 IN A WAY 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-85782-86249 AND THEN THERE'S THE RED VERSION WHICH IS ER MIXED WITH ER BLENDED CHILLIES AND 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-86254-86494 ERM SPICES FROM THE INDIAN FAMILY 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-87602-87928 IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT THE CHICKEN BUT IT'S MORE ABOUT HOW THE RICE IS COOKED 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-87945-88573 IT'S ERM MOSTLY COOKED WITH I'M NOT REALLY SURE THE ACT~ THE PROPER INGREDIENTS BUT I KNOW THERE'S A GINGER 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-88618-88849 BECAUSE I FOUND GINGER IN MY RICE BEFORE 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-88852-88973 ERM

S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-90716-91297 NO I W~ I ACTUALLY BIT INTO IT SO THAT WAS A PROBLEM BUT LIKE ERM 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-91323-92547 YAH AND LIKE THE WAY THE WAY THE CHICKEN IS COOK IT DEPENDS ON THE THE THE THE CHICKEN RICE THAT YOU ORDERED IT COULD BE HAINANESE IT COULD BE DIFFERENT FORMS AS MALAY FORM OF CHICKEN RICE BUT THE BASIS OF THE RICE ITSELF IS THE SAME FOR ALL 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-92554-92712 ALL ARE DIFFERENT 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-92761-93055 UM CUISINES OF DIFFERENT RACES IN A WAY 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-93082-93714 BUT IN GENERAL LIKE ERM IF YOU LOOK AT THE CHINESE VERSION OF CHICKEN RICE ITSELF IT'S 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-93728-94332 ER IT'S MOSTLY STEAMED OR ROASTED CHICKEN AND THEN THERE'S THEY ALSO HAVE LIKE DIFFERENT INCORPORATIONS WITH 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-94349-94462 ERM 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-94726-95003 BUT THAT WILL BE DUCK RICE ALREADY SO IT'S NOT CHICKEN ANYMORE 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-95081-95497 BUT UH AS IN TERMS OF THE ROASTED CHICKEN 
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-95775-96367 SO LIKE THAT'S WHY I FEEL ABOUT CHICKEN RICE ITSELF LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT VARIATIONS OF IT BUT THE BASIS AS THE RICE ITSELF

S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-20690-24726 THOSE KIND OF STUFF LAH SO UH BASICALLY THIS KIND OF EXERCISES IT'S NOT REALLY LIKE TESTING LIKE OKAY LIKE BODYBUILDING IS LIKE GOING FOR AESTHETICS AND STUFF LIKE THAT BUT THEN FOR A POWER LIFTING IT'S ER MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT IT'S NOT JUST LIKE HOW YOU LOOK OR HOW MUCH MUSCLE MASS YOU HAVE BUT IT'S REALLY LIKE HOW YOU CAN IT LIKE UTILIZE YOUR MUSCLE FIBERS SO THERE'S UH APART FROM LIKE HAVING MUSCLE RIGHT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO USE THE MUSCLE GROUPS LIKE THE MUSCLE FIBERS THAT YOU HAVE SO A LOT OF THE BODY BUILDERS YOU SEE WHEN THEY GO TO THE GYM THEY BECOME VERY BIG THEN THEY ARE HAD THEY HAVE A VERY LARGE MASS OF MUSCLE LAH BUT THEN LIKE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC TRAINING TO TEACH THEM HOW TO LIKE UTILIZE THE MUSCLE FIBRES 
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-24745-25381 TO THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL SO YOU SEE A LOT OF THEM ACTUALLY NOT VERY STRONG LIKE RELATIVE TO THE SIZE THAT THEY HAVE 
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-25394-26610 BUT FOR POWER LIFTING YOU FOCUS ON STRENGTH SO EVEN A SMALLEST OF GUYS THEY CAN LIFT LIKE THE HEAVIEST OF WEIGHTS SO IT'S REALLY ABOUT TRAINING YOUR CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM TO PERFORM TO A PEAK LIKE TO COME TO PEAK PERFORMANCE EVERY TIME IT COULD 
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-26618-26854 EVERY TIME YOU'RE TRYING TO PERFORM THE MAXIMUM LIFT

S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-28231-29088 UH OKAY LIKE I MEAN PEOPLE DON'T REALLY DISCUSS POWER LIFTING IN TERMS OF STATIC AND DYNAMIC FORCES BECAUSE IT'S VERY LIKE TECHNICAL LAH AND I DON'T THINK EVERYBODY HAS THE 
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-29093-30281 LIKE NOT EVERYBODY DOING POWER LIFTING HAS THE KNOWLEDGE TO DISCUSS THAT BUT THEN I MEAN I MEAN IT'S DEFINITELY INVOLVE IN ER IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER LAH LIKE ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT REALLY DISCUSSED BUT UM 
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-30316-34027 POWER LIFTING IS MORE LIKE A STATIC FORCE I WOULD SAY BECAUSE THE RANGE OF MOTION AND EVERYTHING YOU ARE DOING RIGHT IS LIKE YOU ARE DOING IN ONE SINGLE PLANE YAH LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THE SQUAT YOU TAKE OUT THE YOU ER AFTER YOU UNWRAP THE BAR RIGHT YOU ARE JUST IN LIKE ONE SINGLE PLANE AND WHEN YOU SQUAT YOU ARE IN A SINGLE PLANE SO IT'S ALWAYS LIKE A DYNAMIC MOVEMENT BUT THEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY BEING IN ER THE POSITION DOESN'T REALLY CHANGE AND THE FORCE WHEN YOU ARE GENERATING THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FORCE RIGHT IT'S WHEN YOU ARE IN A STATIONARY POSITION AT THE LOWEST POINT OF YOUR SQUAT SO LIKE AFTER YOU SQUAT DOWN YOU WANT TO STAND UP AGAIN RIGHT BUT THEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF WEIGHT ON YOUR BACK SO THAT IS THE POINT RIGHT LIKE STATIC POINT WHERE YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO GENERATE THE MOST AMOUNT OF FORCE TO BRING YOUR BODY UP SO 
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-34062-34249 UM LIKE 
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-34277-35574 ON WHEN YOU GO ONLINE AND READ STUFF LIKE THAT THEY DON'T REALLY TALK ABOUT FORCES LAH I MEAN LIKE CAUSE NOT EVERYBODY WOULD BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT BUT THEN WHEN YOU READ RIGHT LIKE YOU CAN CORELATE IT TO WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT IN SCHOOL LIKE MAN MADE FORCES AND STUFF LIKE THAT YAH SO DEFINITELY A ICABLE UM
