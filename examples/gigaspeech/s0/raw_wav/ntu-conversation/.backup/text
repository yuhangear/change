S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-01350-01473 hi
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-02213-02502 oh just now er i came from school i stay in the hall
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-02799-03026 er i have one more paper next monday
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-03664-03872 er currently in accounting
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-04187-04346 yah it was my first choice
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-04892-06697 oh okay erm okay so like previously right cause normally on a normal basis right i like to do like a lot of community service ah so i was thinking of doing social work as erm yah but then like after like i talk to a lot of people and like even like s~ current social workers right then they were advising like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-06702-08877 i'm s~ like still quite young lah so like then they say like it's better not to go straight and and start out as a social worker because like we all know that like social worker like their hours are long then like they don't get paid very high also unless you really have the like burning passion in you which you think can last for very long right then like you really shouldn't go for it lah like so like she say like since i remember this social worker once told me that like she is like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-08890-09310 singapore is quite a practical society right then like you should
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-09365-15329 actually do something more practical first then like when you are more stable your financial you’re financially more stable right then you move on to the social service sector in the future lah because like erm you don't really need like a social work degree to actually help people lah like you can actually help it like at your own time anytime when you are free even when you are studying also so like she say it's better like you can get school on and do something more practical first so i was like thinking through like a lot of different courses i know that i i definitely won't want do engineering cause i've done research before and i really don't like it then like other aspect like science and i thought like er after j c i thought enough ah science is that's it ah no more science already lah don't really like it also then like i'm not very language person also so then like i'm better with numbers ah so i know like accounting would be a better choice lah yah so after i thought so long then like i thought i might as well just try for accounting ah like uh a lot of people ask me then why don’t you just go for business ah but i i was thinking like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-100008-100412 different things ah yah be it like how to interact with people or be it your
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-100529-100725 paperwork and stuff yah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-101042-101557 s~ yah no more ah now because very obvious to me also lah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-101745-102132 yah he really like just scolded me for it you know then i was like wow
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-102161-102263 so shock
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-103009-103892 yah i i was like i remember the exact word he said to me was like this space for who for me is it wah i was like i shock ah i didn't even know how to re~ respond to that ah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-104886-105025 er
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-105033-105468 it's just every day scolding about like how bad my paperwork is and stuff lah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-106491-106741 um yah got lah got lah i mean like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-106805-107766 we have to move on with life lah no point like y~ you remember about this kind of bad things all the while because like even though like i didn't feel like he was a good superior but at least
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-107776-108273 i don't deny that i did learn things from him lah like you know how you deal with people and stuff
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-108305-108608 and h~ how you should present yourself ah because he was telling me like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-108615-108873 i remember at the end before i left right he told me like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-108911-109291 he was always very harsh on my paperwork because like he say subsequently when i go uni
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-109304-110183 i will understand why lah which i did understand now lah so like even though like actually two weeks back we there was a co~ cohesion and i met him like we still talk like normal then like everything was
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-110188-110360 okay lah yah because like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-110364-111122 no matter how bad some things are right like there's still always a a positive outcome to it it just a perspective of life lah yah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-111565-112133 and at at the end yah lah during that time when you never lah but in the end yah he did he still did lah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-113454-114923 yah sometimes i will lah like is like oh my god what like my friends they are formatting but then i i will just like er at the end i'll just t~ tie up all everything myself lah because like this not army lah or i won't scold them or anything lah right i just do it myself lah yah everything is fine lah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-116061-116379 m b s friends i won't say no lah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-116385-117339 but because like school school started only fourteen weeks ago lah like i won't say like they are so close until i mean i do have a group of close friends lah but
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-117349-119642 but m b s you know everyone is busy with their own life and not really ah but i did rope alot of my j c friends in to go with me lah yah so like sometimes i volunteer lah and we will meet and then meet there also like a catch up also as you as you do volunteer work ah because now everyone is dispersed already what yah so so so quite nice when you see them coming back also yah when you actually see your friend coming back together to volunteer with you so quite a nice feeling lah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-121397-121709 oh er okay i've okay for me right like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-121720-122379 i take quite a personal stance like in a sense that i try my to tell myself that i do not want to be too personal to them ah because like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-122492-122663 as you know like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-122671-124238 no dinner last forever lah so like at the end right like you have to part also lah so like i don't want to end up parting where everyone like very sad then emotional and then breakdown and cry and stuff lah because some of some some of them really will do that you know so like i told myself right like i will just like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-124256-125449 befriend them but like i don't want to get to personal to them also lah there's always my stance lah so like but then like it's als~ i feel like it's just just nice also because like even subsequently when they come back they still recognize you then they will still talk to you
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-125470-125745 and say hi to you yah so i thought like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-125754-126397 currently like i'm at a quite okay stairs ah like where the line is drawn just nice ah yah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-126893-127203 oh oh wow okay i didn't know i talk so long
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-15331-15526 what an accounting student can do right
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-15559-16194 a business student cannot do but uh what a business student can do right an accounting student can do also lah so like if i do accounting is more like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-16209-16975 two in one also like s~ it makes more sense ah to me lah yah so like after all these consideration i thought for quite a long period of time then i decided do accounting
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-17590-18062 oh okay so like back then in my school in my j c right like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-18078-20644 uh every c c a lab and class right actually like every year we have to do c i p one it's compulsory for us ah yah so then after that my c c a i remember then like my vice president he managed to link up with y m c a then like we started to do a c i p together ah then subsequently from then onwards right even though after i graduated even until now right i will still continue to do lah because like i found that i really enjoy what i'm doing enjoy it really serving the community and helping people lah so yah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-21258-26743 er okay so like erm because now currently right i do with quite a lot of different organisation also ah but for like let's say for y m c a right so y m c a part right i'm not not really say volunteering now already i'm more of like in the planning committee so like i always help to plan like the all the events organisation not not organisation sorry the event and all the i'm in the organising committee ah so like and then i help to plan all the events then have to recruit volunteers in already because like after you are you volunteer with them for quite some time then they will usually want you to come and help them with all their planning and stuff also so for a y m c a side right i more of helping to plan events now already rather than actually volunteering already which is also quite nice because like sometimes right you will see that regular volunteers also will keep coming back then they will slowly subsequently they also start to join you onboard to help plan events then it's quite a nice feeling also ah yah then for my other
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-26802-27799 organisation part like recently i also join like this organisation called health-serve i'm not sure whether you know about is it helps like all the foreign workers that are currently like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-27802-28473 this they suffer injuries during work then they cannot work now so like what health-serve does is like they give them free medical services
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-28477-29389 to help them like treatment and then like they help them if they are get incur in some law lawsuit because of their injury but then like their superior though doesn't want to pay or what then
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-29402-29700 then they will help them to find lawyers also and like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-29713-31120 have to help them settle because like when they come all the way to singapore they don't have any family or what they are also very lo~ they are at a loss ah so but for my part because i'm not like medically trained or anything so what i also help to do is also like occasionally plan events for them
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-31132-33020 like more of them just need to be there to be their friend you know to accompany them talk to them so that they don't feel like lonely ah because like when they don't work also right they really don't have anything else to do they just like read every time all the while have nothing to do lah yah but recently finals ah so like now tone down a bit lah yah when ah subsequently i'll start continuing soon ah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-33369-33498 currently year one
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-34259-34707 probably lah yah so it's it been like since j c even during my army time
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-34724-35617 cause honestly like it doesn't really take that much of a time right like at most every saturday you just go do something yah for a few hours only like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-35631-35948 it's all how much time you're willing to commit lah this
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-36437-36594 from school last time yah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-36981-39567 y~ yah because like back then in school right usually cause you know got c i p hours then last time you always do for the sake of doing for the hours ah but then like subsequently for me at least ah like i found that i really actually enjoy it rather than just doing for the sake of the hours ah which is quite pointless lah then so even though until now i will still conti~ continue doing lah because like it really the satisfaction is there lah when you see that people really enjoy what you do for them yah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-40367-41894 er in hall not really lah hall hall life ve~ very tiring also ah but as in for n t u side i also recently i just join w s c side lah yah um i went to join the deaf community to learn sign language also too
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-41904-42393 so like subsequently next year onwards also i i will be teaching deaf students tuition also
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-43470-44786 previously before i came uni cause like you know got a long period of waiting time then i went to learn ah but then after that when i found out that like n t u also got the deaf community there i join them then they also send us for sign language classes also lah so recently all the classes just ended then
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-44789-45140 then next year onwards we will when we teach the deaf student then
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-45149-45335 you will use it more already lor
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-45535-45862 ah yah okay lah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-48302-49567 oh er f~ currently for now ah my plan is that i will just be an accountant for like a few years then until like i feel like i'm more financially stable already then subsequently in the next time i maybe then go over to the social service sector
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-49739-50511 but then of course when during my time as a accountant i was still like free time ah just go and help also lah because like no harm or what yah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-51401-52905 that one s~ maybe next time lah sees when we got time then see how lah yah because like really lah you don't really need a paper certification to help you unless you really want to be like a full time social worker or what then yah you need lah but for now it's more i just wanna
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-52925-53114 volunteer and help people ah because like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-53140-53836 i also know that like sometimes right your passion cannot really pick your career lah because once it becomes your career right
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-53876-54214 it's a whole new ball game already lah like it will change lah a lot of things to change ah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-56463-56563 er
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-56584-57929 i won't really say every moment but it's more of like usually at the end of a like an event ah or what because like some if you go back often right you realize that as in the beneficiaries of course they will recognize you ah so then like sometimes at the end right like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-57935-59977 at the e~ when they just come to you right and then like some erm they just like some some of them like young kids especially then they will just like hug you and then say thank you #kor-kor# something then like wah that moment is like your heart will be like wah melt already yah but other than that i won't say there's a like major event that like impact me lah it's more of like usually at the end you know
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-59995-60213 a simple thank you like is good enough already ah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-61212-61912 usually as in currently right for me now right i trying to expose myself to the different kind of
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-62077-63328 different groups yah you get what i mean right so like i have helped like young kids uh then the poor and then the blind and then currently doing the deaf also the elderly also then like more or less i feel like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-63347-64086 oh okay lah but i just realized that i really cannot interact with elderly ah that's my conclusion ah so like it's not say like i don't want to help them or what but
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-64100-64800 i just got nothing to say to them you know like i remember this moment that i was just sitting at a table with another volunteer
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-64814-67779 then the other volu~ that volunteer also quit new then we were with a whole table of elderly right then like both of us just like awkwardly sitting there like didn't know what to say you know then like because like it's not very nice you just talk to one or two of them then you neglect the rest as in like i don't really know how to like engage a group of elderly then because there's sometimes right elderly tend to be more sensitive then like i'm also afraid of like saying the wrong thing yah so like usually right now right like if i can right i would avoid working with elderly lah it's not that i don't want to step out of my comfort zone but i've tried but like it just doesn't didn't work out lah so like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-67786-68277 besides elderly most of the time i've exposed myself to most group already lah then like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-68287-68564 even foreign workers also now so like yah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-68602-68745 okay ah most of them
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-68764-68942 i'm okay with most of them ah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-69101-70404 yah as in yah it's not it's not that i'm not okay with them like if sometimes if they ask me to go and help elderly i will still go lah but usually if i can ah i will just not go lah b because like i really cannot interact there's just um maybe generation gap or something ah i just can't ah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-70550-71126 then some of them like when they speak like hokkien to you then like you also understand then yah then the language barrier also there
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-71377-71486 yah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-71587-71934 yah then like sometimes i understand but i don't know how to reply them you know like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-74045-75711 er hall b ah usually i like to run lah on my own ah but er not not like on a competitive basis ah like own lei~ lei~ leisure run then sometimes run marathon here and there free time yah nothing much lah then if not means at home watch watch dramas or stuff lah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-75724-76107 yah but in hall in my hall i just play hockey ah but
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-76158-76989 uh bef~ bef~ bef~ before uni i didn't have any like experience ah i just want to try something new also so yah other than that yah that's it lah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-78545-78649 er
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-78691-79123 wah okay er my army life ah i would say like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-79213-79523 it's fulfilling lah uh yah because like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-79533-80240 my whole of year one i was like really just doing like all the combat training like always go in the forest like almost
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-80248-80529 half half of the time is in the forest one ah then
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-80556-81497 lots of training then everytime get scolding then like it's quite like physically and mentally draining lah but then subsequently in year two when i
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-81503-83826 commission already because i was in a officer ah so then yah commission already right but then they posted me to h q ah uh headquarter there then i do a lot of paperwork so then it's more if if because er like a totally different story because like what you learn how to fight in a forest is not relevant in how to do the paperwork ah so like but then like the good thing about my army life i feel like i was there i learn both the hard skill and the soft skills lah so like you
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-83830-84516 like hard skill wife like maybe like all the i i'm better at excel now and words like how to do all the paperwork
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-84524-84802 but then like soft skills uh you really learn how to like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-84861-85805 deal with people lah like cause you really meet all kind of people be it your superior or your or your guys below you lah like you learn how to take a different approach
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-85831-86157 to to to different people ah because like some people right
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-86204-87618 even though like army people always think discipline discipline but some people obviously they clearly don't care one ah yah some people don't they they just don't bother one ah so like you need to find like many different ways to approach them like if you want to get them to do things scolding doesn't always help you know like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-87636-88033 you you need to find like what's the right way to approach them some of them like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-88056-88683 it's better if you can approach them from a friend point of view but rather some of them like y~ some of them it's just like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-88733-89325 y~ they they don't really want to help you no matter what one ah so like you really need to see how to work your way
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-89340-89511 around things lor yah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-89515-90268 yah then like when you talk to your superior also like some of them just very anal about things you know like i remember once my superior right like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-90275-91766 my document i submitted like s~ my report to him lah then then after that he look he he call me to his office right then after that ask him yah so um is there any wrong thing wrong with my thing lah then he pointed er to the to me it's like this this spacing lah in between two words right
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-91783-91927 then he ask me what's wrong
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-91958-93020 then i look at him i i don't see anything wrong ah then he say can't you this space so big for who he ask me is it for me then i say er no ah sir l then you double space for what
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-93052-93156 then i was like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-93239-94721 er okay sorry sir yah then i was like damn stun ah because like double spacing like i didn't even realise it notice it but he actually like noticed that i double space by accident then like he made me redo the whole thing and like reprint the whole thing then he scolded me for wasting paper cause i didn't my job properly but
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-94726-95893 i was just like my my thinking like if you are willing because he doesn't like to read softcopy he like to be hardcopy then i was thinking like if you were willing to read softcopy then like i wouldn't have to waste paper also right but then like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-95905-96201 also my fault lah cause like i double space lah yah lah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session1-2-96236-96602 yah cause he is very anal about like all the formatting and paperwork lah

S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-36598-37449 oh okay so like if you want to go for some sightseeing right then i would think that you can go to like gardens-by-the-bay
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-37488-37707 or maybe you sentosa
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-37712-38978 okay so like erm if how to get there it's like if you same thing if you coming from n t u right then once you get onto the green line from #boon-lay# m r t then just take it down towards pasir-ris direction you can get off
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-39052-39840 if you want to go to gardens-by-the-bay first you can get off at raffles-place then after that you switch over to the red line and then you can get off at marina-bay
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-39959-41132 then once you are at marina-bay like gardens-by-the-bay is like really nearby so it will be quite obvious lah if you're not sure how to get there also you can ask the control station there then like the gardens-by-the-bay is like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-41165-41369 in my opinion is just like erm
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-41381-43528 a very big garden that that the government created to attract tourists lah so like but then the the scenery wise is quite nice like i feel like it's would definitely worth a trip to go explore and most of the places are free although there's like some pass that you have to pay for so like it's optional whether you want to pay to enter those places but i think it's definitely worth like making a trip down
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-43547-43908 and it will be best if you go to at night ah because it's a open area then like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-43920-45118 it will be very hot if you go in the afternoon and like at night if you go there's also lightings to see so it's much more nice to go visit the gardens-by-the-bay at the at night ah alternatively if you
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-45157-45408 just want to have to like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-45424-46180 enjoy yourself not say is super more more sightseeing but like if you just want to have a fun time then you can go to like sentosa
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-46214-46944 so sentosa side right like same thing right if you get from #boon-lay# m r t you you will get off at outram-park station
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-46950-48020 then after that you switch over to the purple line towards harbourfront then you can get off at the harbourfront station so at the harbour front station you can either switch to their monorail which you have to pay four dollar for
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-48028-48577 or you can just walk walk in via the broadwalk which is currently free if i'm not wrong
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-48592-50027 yah then once you get to sentosa right there's a lot of things you can do then so although a lot of things are expensive there but like it's worth making like a trip down there so you can you can either like go for the universal-studios there where is basically a theme park
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-50037-50271 or you can go to the
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-50295-51241 the wax museum okay to take a look there okay cause like the wax figure there actually quite cool ah quite nice ah yah <cs/> if not you can just go to the beach and have a
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-51250-51712 fun time there to enjoy yourself at the beach get some suntanning

S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-53640-54847 oh for night life okay um depending what kind of night life you're referring to so like if you want to go like erm drinking just purely like bars and pubs then like you can consider going to holland-village
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-54854-55995 or maybe even clarke-quay there but er personally i would think like holland-village is a nicer place ah for drinking cause like their their mostly all pubs there so like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-56057-56163 people
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-56176-57091 it's more mature people prefer to go there lah i feel like in my opinion ah so like they weren't there's l~ it's less likely to have like troubles there like and then like there are a lot of
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-57155-60990 more mature adults you can see see that goes there to drink so like you won't have to worry about like there being a havoc yah so like how you can get to holland-village is that you take the train also so from #boon-lay# station also then you get down at buona-vista then you switch over to the circle line towards um dhoby-ghaut or marina-bay then after that you just take one stop and get off at holland-village so then from holland-village right once you come out from the station right like towards there at night you can see that there are a lot of pubs ah so you can see which one you would like to go to and i have a drink there or or alternatively alternatively if you um
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-61000-61580 <unk> you are looking to go towards like club or what or just or club and drinking then can go towards clarke-quay
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-61611-61917 kay so clarke-quay like how you can go there is like you can
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-61926-63111 get off at outram-park same thing on the green line then you switch over to the purple line again then purple line towards punggol then after that you get off at clarke-quay station so at clarke-quay station then from then on erm
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-63119-64478 at night i think it's quite obvious where all the famous plub pubs and clubs pubs and clubs are so yah then from there you can like see you at where you want to go to and like have a good time with your friends yah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-66525-66684 okay
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-66831-67161 okay so the first one would wake up your idea right so basically is
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-67186-68465 when someone u~ u~ usually your superior will use it towards you like when you mess up or like you just screw up something right then like he will it's a spof~ it's a form of scolding lah to wake up your idea lah to basically like stop
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-68471-68636 messing things up and like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-68661-69460 start to be more organized and like know what you are doing ah yah so that's wake up your idea so yah usually comes in the form of screaming at you ah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-69583-70591 oh is becky um this one i never really come across it before lah but i'm guessing that it refers to someone that is bespectacled i think i'm not very sure ah um yah

S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-71068-72389 okay so the next one is don't make your problem my problem lah this is a very famous like lingo that a lot of people u~ usually it's also like it also your superiors say to you lah so usually if you cause some problem already right like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-72418-73873 somehow you screw up something and then you messed it up then you went to tell your superior then if your superior is not a very nice person that doesn't want to help you right usually you'll tell him um dont' make your problem my problem lah so like in other words he's telling him to go and solve your own problem ah yah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-73978-75072 so the next one you think i thought who confirm right is usually when also same thing like usually when like sergeants tell them guys also when when their guys tell them like oh i thought like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-75088-77306 this is su sed to be done like that then i thought like oh i'm su sed to go there then usually if the superiors like very bad mood right then he'll be like you think i told then who confirm so like in other words in other words basically like don't make assumptions ah yah so bo~ #bobo-shooter# right the next one right is basically someone that cannot shoot well like every time you shoot you just miss
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-77308-77508 yah so we call them #bobo-shooters#
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-77532-77719 kay drop twenty is just
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-77736-78340 also usually is happens in b m t then your sergeant just tell you drop twenty in other words you just need to do twenty push up

S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-79658-79895 smoke out it's like somebody will just throw like
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-79950-80771 it can use both literally and figuratively lah smoke out basically if you say literally right like in the outfield training right and smoke smoke out then
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-80778-83750 once a person somebody will throw of smoke bomb then everyone else will run and withdraw from the place lah that's the literal meaning ah but figuratively right smoke out as basically someone like basically you you screw up something already right then after that they were somebody usually like the i c or s~ some the leader of the that group right they will try as tell their superiors some bullshit story and like like flick ah smoke smoke their way through and then like try and cover up the story ah yah so that's the figurative li~ meaning of smoke out ah so depend on the context

S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-90218-91524 okay er wake up your blood bloody idea lah so it's the same like wake up your idea lah it's just a more crude form of telling the person to like get get your shit together and like stop messing things up lah
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-91531-92284 yup o r d lor is like what everyone will say including me will say now lah because like basically means you are operationally ready
S1-mml-1-dec-2017-a-session3-2-92287-93234 date ready has reached and then like you are um discharged from the two years of national-service already ah so usually you'll say that to someone that hasn't o r d to make them feel bad lah

S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-12847-14275 so we have er we so we are planning act to teach them english maths science and mostly we are teaching grade one to six for the first part of the trip and then after that it's uh younger kids for the second part of the trip yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-14629-16744 because in the am the malay-culture-society #perbayu# right um o e was the only one which was humanitarian which want will which was helping the kids ah and i know i was going to be heavily involved since it's a overseas expedition but then i wanted to try something new because last semester i was quite bored with just studying yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-17271-19081 so i i hope to um be more grateful with what i have and open my mind to more uh o rtunities and because for me i am more or i'm not the kind that will take risks so i hope i'm hoping that with these o e i will take more risks during their trip and even after that also
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-19645-19773 um
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-19841-20868 yah we have mostly b~ the bulk is proposal but i don't mind because ever since in secondary school i enjoyed doing these admin proposal work and planning because i don't really like
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-20881-21837 um i don't really like no not knowing what the programme is so i rather be in control of the programme and know and like give my maca~ uh like to
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-21861-22867 my two cents worth of what i want the programme to be like and how i think it should be because i feel like if i wasn't in the programmes' team then i would i may not like what i'm doing yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-22945-23045 yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-23418-24305 yah more of er knowing what i eh i have to do and in control of what i can do and whether it is beneficial for the kids or not ah yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-24853-27983 yah it's um to educate the kids and to because even though we have um how to say like the less advantage people in singapore is not as it's not as bad as the other countries like for example in cambodia because it's still in singapore we are still quite shelter and pampered because for our pre trip we have to also volunteer in another org~ in an organization like #muhammadiyah# or #darul-ihsan# eh that kind of organisations with kids but then we realized that even the kids there even the
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-27989-30000 erm in even the people we talk to they're like the staff there are aware that the people in singapore are not as erm are not as disadvantaged as those in cambodia and they are given food they are they have proper education and proper clothing and all so um in singapore i won't say that the
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-30045-30752 disadvantaged are as bad as those a abroad so i ra~ i want to go there and actually experience it first hand yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-31537-31681 um
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-32156-32400 yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-32533-32655 um
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-32766-34285 big uh i think if i'm going with at least someone i'm comfortable with then i don't mind because i'm more of a people person and i need someone to lean on and uh i'm not the kind that will go on solo trips that like
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-34287-35650 will actually come out of my comfort zone and do all these things on my own because i want someone to be dependent on someone i can share with ah if i'm on the trip and if i'm going on this big kind of all the way to africa
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-35656-36574 then if it's with people that i'm comfortable with like family i don't mind going but if it's like new people that i don't i haven't met before then i'm not comfortable in going yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-37466-37616 i t is
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-37629-38042 yah personally to me i think it's maybe uh just
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-38057-38314 the development like
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-38328-39316 if even if you don't have these basic things i guess you would need to have a positive thinking and the government needs to learn how to adapt to the changing
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-39334-40091 changing climate of the world and actually dev~ continue developing instead of just staying stagnant at as a third world country yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-40500-40652 yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-40870-41016 um
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-41403-41518 um
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-41705-44462 i'm cause now i'm staying in hall so i rarely have the chance to interact with my neighbours or anything and my house is at the is at the area where it's like one corridor only has two units so i only have one other neighbour and i'm not mostly at home even though where even when i'm not in hall also i'm not at home like in secondary school or j c i'm rarely at home i'll always be in school so i rarely have the chance to interact with them so i would say that
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-44472-45045 er i don't really help because yah the i can't really help also at the same time yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-45254-45924 yah i have one other sister who is twenty nine now so it's a big age gap of nine years yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-46042-46506 uh no she's she's not married er but she's working
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-46641-46819 yah she stays with my parents
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-46953-47377 er she also not really close to the neighbours cause she
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-47411-49322 can be she's like me she's can be social she's sociable if i want to but the other like cause my neighbours are not the kind that will be sociable also like the other just the one other neighbor so if they are not sociable so i won't really go out of my way to like oh hi how's your day that kind so it kind of like mine is like bounce off kind of social yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-49735-49849 friendly
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-49985-51554 oh no cause the one other unit uh that is along the corridor is me is er we have the they keep changing so this is throughout my whole nine nineteen years is they are the third neighbor to live there already so before that was er um
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-51589-54707 it was another family also but we weren't really close cause they they stayed there and then they moved out again because we had lift renovation work and they will had and they had a baby so they didn't want to stay there for long but before that we were very close to this uh other family because they always when they cook right then they will give us some leftovers or yah and then they also cause their families also always come over so whenever their families come then we also know their families ah and they are very friendly people so yah uh we are very close to that neighbour because
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-54719-55203 erm i was in the same school as that neighbour also and she will
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-55207-56754 and whenever cause my i both my parents work and they have grandparents in that house so whenever after school i will actually go over to their house and like do my work or they would take care of me and feed me yah so that's like the nicest memory i have ah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-56798-56901 yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-57175-58558 yah my parents are still in touch because they also still um i still stay in tampines and they also they also still stay in tampines so whenever they have weddings or any big gatherings they will invite my parents and yah #hari-raya# also they will invite my parents yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-59159-59274 uh
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-59404-61878 yah i think i'll continue being the bouncer also because i'm scared when whenever i become too friendly i'm scared that they will be like i'll be too intrusive into their life or cause even personally for myself if i'm not in the friendly mode i won't be i don't want anyone to be like oh hi how's your day i want people to give me my space yah so maybe like there are certain people that are like that and i respect that ah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-62153-62294 um
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-62459-62563 um
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-62679-63589 i think because they are the ones that will be there when you're not around at home and your home is where you always go to and without without them i feel
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-63620-65280 you won't have anyone to rely on if there's a real there's a real emergency like for example if you're overseas or something and you need to water your plants or er you left something behind or you just suspect something wrong with then you can always count on your neighbours ah yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-66133-66258 yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-66708-66949 yah cause um
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-66999-67981 i think it's good that the government has put in the you know the racial quota only certain race can you up to a maximum quota and there are also
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-67998-70775 a lot of events that the g r c will organise er i think it's the g r c yah i'm not so sure but at the c c they will organise like oh if there's #chinese-new-year# coming around then they will oh #chinese-new-year# gathering or #hari-raya# gathering or #deepavali# gathering so it's like this kind of um small not say small but smaller scale events for the neighborhood that can bring people together like f~ when my father is also er like an r c member
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-70782-72390 yah so he is also in charge of like organizing this thing and he pulls us along some time so from that also he can meet like people living around us and um we can meet our neighbours even though it may not be direct but at least it's within the same area
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-73804-74401 um maybe by going to the um events then maybe pulling
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-74431-75079 if i don't know maybe pulling my friends along also yah cause i do have friends who stay in the same area
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-75100-77189 en yah and actual and not just go ah but actually interact with the people there cause even though if you go also then if you don't interact then it's a bit um pointless so actually just go and interact and when you see the same few faces in the at the carpark or at the void deck or wherever then just say hi yah that kind of thing
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-77394-77501 yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-78101-78525 language barrier ah language barr~ not really because
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-78561-79161 only with the older people but my h d b don't really have that many
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-79163-79338 old people lah and
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-79375-80453 yah and most of them can speak english even if it's the most basic english so at least can still understand each other and stuff and even though they cannot speak english they can actually speak malay so it's like
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-80475-81158 nope so either way also still can communicate yah even though they are not malay they can uh still understand abit of malay yah

S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-86912-87260 yah and the hall twelve was very open like
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session1-2-87300-89780 there was it wasn't there wasn't any gender segregation so like the boys can co~ access can have access to the female block and the female will have access to the male block and even so right it's like a u shape and girls can see the boys' room and the boys can see the girls' room so it's like a bit of um i didn't like i didn't really like that was so awkward so i decided to go for tamarind which is like a more like

S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-104736-106088 um okay it's eh it doesn't literally mean throw face but it's like a figure of speech so it's like for example you did something embarrassing say like eh you throw face i think it is a direct translation from chinese word
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-10478-11063 kay so the shuttle bus we have campus loop red which brings us around n t u
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-106101-106293 yah so it's like er
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-106339-107489 er throw face like you do something shameless so for example um you when #koufu# is closing for example then you ask hey do you have any leftovers then that that one that means you throw your fa~ throw face yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-107533-108053 yah yah embarrass yourself and you are not shameless and you're like shameless yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-108547-109404 #sotong# oh yah it is a food which means squid but then like squid is known to be erm like very slow very
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-109422-110492 erm it's normally called like blur blur #sotong# so it's like you don't know anything that's happening around you so for example if erm in lessons you don't understand what the
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-110509-111478 what the professor is saying then you keep asking your friend then your friend will be like eh you #sotong# lah you it means like eh you are her very unaware of all these things yah

S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-111768-111906 so
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-111913-112424 yah like you ask er like you for example if someone doesn't know
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-112433-112966 er okay for example you your two friends have been together for very long and you're quite shock ah but then you like
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-112969-113688 then um you ask them oh my god you all are together and the and then they will say eh you #sotong# lah you we've been together for so long so it's like
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-113691-113852 like erm
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-113866-114294 how come how can you not know it yah something very obvious yah

S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-114993-115156 oh
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-115167-115781 yah okay cause #ulu# is like very er secluded like it's <unk> like n t u is like literally at

S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-116916-118143 it's has its own boundary and noone else is takes so long to go there so #ulu# means secluded and away from civilisation yah in the n t u in the n t u meaning ah yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-11822-11956 oh that is free
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-118672-118854 yah no problem
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-11996-12518 but the students paid for in their miscellaneous fees i think
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-12667-12838 uh if you are a student yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-12887-13080 er yah then you paid for it too

S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-18568-18950 yah chinatown is the north-east-line which is the purple line
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-18953-19113 so you have to take
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-19138-19756 from #boon-lay# you take the m r t towards erm pasir-ris and then you take
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-19766-19986 all the way to outram-park

S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-69329-69976 uh no there's also the curry fish or chicken it's up to you and but that is quite spicy
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-69978-70534 but also if you can't take spice then normally sugar you can eat with sugar yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-70564-70818 yah but it will be quite dry i think
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-71929-72294 oh yah that is er the half boiled egg
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-72302-73236 yah that is what mostly singaporeans will go for if they just want a not so heavy breakfast so they were normally go coffee shops will sell erm
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-73286-74337 egg half boiled eggs with toast then the toast has erm #kaya# or butter or peanut butter and with a drink a hot drink like coffee milo or tea yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-74425-74597 yah it's like a set meal
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-74694-75310 yah relatively cheap compared to um other cafes and stuff yah cause
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-75329-75723 coffee shops are actually the cheapest option in singapore yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-76361-76550 light lunch
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-76552-77119 light lunch then i suggest not to go for rice can go for like noodles
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-77129-77400 yah or just anything soup cause
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-77434-78174 er but then i suggest you should go try the chicken-rice cause their serving is also not that big singapore's chicken-rice yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-78309-78414 yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-78733-79696 no it's actually roasted chicken or if you want healthier you can choose to go for steamed chicken and the rice i think is cooked with er
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-79707-80394 garlic or ginger i don't know which one yah but it's erm like very flavorful and
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-80418-80541 er
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-80604-81160 nice smelling the rice yah it's just not plain rice is actually there's a different
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-81172-81482 it's different ah er don't know how to explain yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-81920-82033 yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-82173-82865 erm you can find what if you are in the east area you should go to bedok there there's simpang bedok there
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-82887-83225 yah but it's actually normally quite crowded
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-83247-84121 but if you're more in central then there's uh g~ there's #satay#-by-the-bay where there's a lot of seafood but that's more pricey but the seafood is guaranteed fresh
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-84131-84946 so yah you can try the seafood there if you don't mind the price and i'm not so sure about the west or the north yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-85129-86395 yah yah #satay#-by-the-bay is also near gardens-by-the-bay so maybe you can like drop by gardens-by-the-bay and it's not that expensive the entrance ticket there's a lot of attractions there yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-86803-87114 um we are famous for chilli-crab
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-87167-88209 yah erm i have tasted chilli-crab once i don't really eat chilli crab alot because i didn't like it the first time i tried it but it's it's like sweet and spicy
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-88250-88573 yah and the and there's a lot of gravy to it
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-88582-88984 and the crab is actually um juicy yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-89098-89227 yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-89371-89536 kay no problem
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-89977-90141 ah okay
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-91347-91468 #kaypoh#
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-91486-92712 oh is for when you are being a busybody then someone will be like eh you #kaypoh# lah you means busybody yah is none of your business but you like wanna run yah just interfere yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-92870-94154 so for example you see erm like an accident on a road and then you see a lot of people gathering around even though it's none of their business can be like oh my god everyone is so #kaypoh# there so everyone is so busybody there yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-94314-94646 yah yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-95064-95189 #alamak#
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-95286-96146 #alamak# the english translation is like oh no like that so for example you forgot to bring your wallet you can be #alamak# i forgot to bring my wallet yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-96215-96791 yah it's not really i don't know what language that is but we singaporeans use it a lot yah
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-97439-97858 #bojio# oh is like when for example erm
S1-mml-13-feb-2018-a-session3-2-97863-99682 a group er your group of friends went out to go and have supper but then didn't invite you so they didn't ask you whether you want to go so you go eh why #bojio# means like why you never invite yah so yah you can say that whenever people don't include you in your plans
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-01716-02014 sure sure er i'm xavier and
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-02223-02444 my hobby is er
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-02538-02859 building scale models building er
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-02933-03080 toys and all that yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-03137-03454 i think it's a really nice hobby because er
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-03547-03660 i can
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-03740-04399 take a lot of time to sit down and just relax you know just slowly build things and
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-04454-04616 it helps to kill time and it
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-04654-04841 trains my patience i think
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-05067-05260 the downside of this hobby is that
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-05305-05488 it is quite expensive
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-05488-05596 yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-05714-05866 tools are expensive
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-06126-06383 uh they are expensive i think one bottle costs like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-06512-06720 four dollar fifty cents and
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-06781-06933 it's only twenty five m l
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-07123-07414 yah but but we have to tint the paint ah so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-07447-08145 it's not that bad but the thinner is also expensive i think two hundred and fifty m l costs like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-08190-08386 twelve dollar fifty cents yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-08471-08730 the the thinner thinner for the paint yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-08839-09101 yah so it's quite an expensive hobby but
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-09220-10042 i think it's worth the the money because when i open up the model kit whi~ which comes in a box
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-100201-100566 from your from your squat you know he comes out then he is
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-100666-101792 like in he he walks very like fibbly you know like then look very tired then people will like eh #ni# #chao keng# ah yah yah yah like eh #chaokeng# ah oh eh john #chao keng# yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-101830-101942 yah but
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-10184-10542 er the plastic parts are usually in their
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-102024-102908 or like some sometimes when when we go to the track and run then some people run until like oh then they stop then they oh chest pain eh eh don't #chao keng# yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-103157-103374 yah that that word
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-103880-103997 huh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-104115-104925 er okay er let me let me think ah because a~ after i i left ah i i i because you never use then you sort of
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-105500-105703 there's a lot lah there's a lot of
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-105724-106069 crazy things inside there ah so i think
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-10580-10839 grey in colour they have no color ah basically so i have to
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-106132-106543 i think the army side they have more lah but for for us we
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-106565-106873 we have lah but not so much ah i i remember there was one time
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-106910-107157 er beginning of training that time right
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-107197-107533 everybody is still like blur blur #sotong# you know so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-107780-108168 the trainer was like he was asking he was calling someone
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-108261-109783 er and then they are that person you know instead of like replying yes sir or something like that he just ah so so the trainer actually asked him to to do like jumping jacks at at the middle of the the
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-10909-11376 assemble them together and then have to paint them so the painting part is quite
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-109860-110057 the coy line ah which is like the
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-110082-110327 that small little open area below the
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-110383-110635 the dormitory and all that ah so is like do jumping jacks
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-110675-112365 every time he do instead of like one two three four two two three four he be like ah because he say ah so ah ah ah so no eh eh uh haven't yet haven't yet i think there's a there's like some curse word inside so he go like ah ah ah #lumpar# ah ah ah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-112448-113629 yah yah #lumpar# is testicles uh is act it's actually a hokkien dialect yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-113865-114057 i think he did that for like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-114103-115365 i think twenty or thirty counts ah so so when he when he start to do ah and his voice is like normal lah like ah ah and then the more he do the more like out of breath he here so his voice start become ah ah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-11431-11541 tedious
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-11595-12220 the assembling also quite tedious because there will be mistakes sometimes the manufacturer they
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-116179-116851 actually i found that i found that quite funny so there was there was one time another guy actually made the same mistake again
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-116904-117938 so we want he he was asked to do it then i i think something where uh something inside me crack lah so i i i what i actually voluntarily go enjoy
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-117972-118129 yah yah but
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-118241-119295 for i don't know why f~ usually people like this this their voice start to become really weird after the twenty count mine got really weird after the tenth count so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-119319-120068 and and it was so weird ah and it sounded so wrong that the trainer asked us to stop
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-120094-120363 yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-120673-120865 alright sure sure thank you
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-12377-12755 correct the mistake use using all the party and stuff like that
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-13057-13876 the end product is quite satisfying because when especially when i take picture okay this is before and then wah wah after ah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-13946-14401 can you can see the big difference ah usually i do this uh during the
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-14475-15159 in between the breaks for the semester so it's like okay december coming so during december maybe i will
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-15206-15433 i will do a bit yah and

S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-32652-33106 i actually i'm at the i'm a police one at the n p c there yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-33138-33288 neighborhood-police-centre
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-33288-33636 yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-33636-33799 yah sure
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-34615-35655 okay i didn't go for b m t this is the yah yah this is the really surprising part uh a lot of people didn't know they thought everyone go through b m t but but no yah i i went straight to
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-35730-36059 i report straight to home-team-academy for training
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-36148-36538 er i i i don't know also because yah when when the letter came is like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-36538-36663 huh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-36663-37145 at home-team-academy i thought su sed to be like usually people like get #tekong# but then i
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-37183-37771 okay then i was like a bit worried ah because it's like different from other people i don't know what to expect
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-37792-38631 because every time in in the media in t v show in movie they always show people er going to #tekong# and all that yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-38664-39003 so i i i'm one of those like outliers yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-39369-40124 they they didn't say they just er give a letter lor so i just just went ah anyway er have to go
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-40368-41007 oh er we trained for er i think four months at home-team-academy but basically
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-41187-41563 like physical training uh penal code all that
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-41610-41745 then some
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-42114-43035 i i don't want to say #kungfu# but you know some some unarm like tactics and all that yah then firearms yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-43278-43432 uh yah yah same duration
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-43947-44318 basically okay because home-team is
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-44541-45225 there's there's a lot of agencies in in home-team ah so i i can say that because everybody can you can go and find that out yourself so it's okay
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-45280-45785 yah there's quite a few ah there's like police civil defence the the fire truck all that
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-45821-45950 there's many other like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-45992-46402 those other su rting agencies ah but the biggest one is
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-46445-46697 the police force ah so basically we

S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-58227-58714 that that valued lah outside in in especially in the private sector and the
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-58714-58823 corporate
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-58977-59389 i'm still thinking about it while i'm going through this
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-59411-59562 four year undergraduate
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-59629-60032 still thinking ah whether i want to do a master later on because
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-60271-60812 my tentative plan right is to right after i graduate i just go and sign up
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-60852-61311 home-team yah or or right before because they always have like roadshow every now and then
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-61311-62914 yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-63123-63545 yah they they do they do sponsor like er
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-63592-63784 further studies lah so you
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-63896-64933 i think there's like two two route ah one is like the really #atas# the really high class the scholar that that kind they they will just pay immediately then you after you finish and come and join in
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-64959-65385 the other one is i think it's those like you join them and you work
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-65466-65795 for a while then after that they will they will let you go and study
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-65795-66151 yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-66151-66861 actually i prefer the progression one because the scholar one very i think quite stressed ah they they will have like some sort of standard ah like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-66882-67013 g p a must be this
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-67037-67677 wah very stress i already very stressed already like like by by itself ah studying like that very stress already so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-68015-68596 give myself less stress it's it's better ah don't don't stress myself out too much yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-69533-70366 er wow a lot of a lot of thing ah but okay lah the h~ the highlight part was the the really
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-70512-70769 the part that really outshine everything was er
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-70844-71017 that day when i
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-71039-71183 graduate from training

S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-71335-71448 because er
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-71800-71948 that there was a point in time
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-71975-72131 halfway through the training i was
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-72150-72305 very demoralized i
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-72431-73502 i i didn't feel like i was doing anything useful you know everyday just run and run and march and march and and you know get punish yah but
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-73572-73929 somewhere like closer to the graduation er
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-74123-74310 my trainer actually kind of like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-74518-74645 tell me lah you know like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-74677-74958 you only get this experience like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-75116-75659 the whole life we can't do n s again already yah he he knows lah because he went through the same
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-75712-75862 path as us what so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-75916-76027 he was like saying like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-76055-76162 you know if you
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-76189-76483 don't make the best ah out of this
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-76540-76847 then every time you look back into n s like wah i
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-77006-77811 i could have you know excelled but i didn't i i chose the easy way out you know like like #chao keng#
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-77863-78239 er don't do er fall sick m c
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-78329-78879 so that that at that point in time i was i i contemplated about it lah so i
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-78934-79179 i started to put in more effort and all that
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-79200-79572 so on the day when graduate all
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-79596-79759 i was quite happy because uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-79860-80356 i they they actually have this scheme ah you can when graduate you
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-80485-80946 can get direct promotion some people don't lah depends on performance
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-80984-81448 so wah i managed to got it lah so i i was quite happy at that time
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-81448-81659 uh yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-81659-82180 oh okay usually when when we graduate right here is nothing one
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-82221-82332 yah but
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-82443-83021 for me and and some other people when they graduate they got corporal ah yah so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-83099-83631 so when you go out right you go out to the different vocation you
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-83739-83937 do your job properly right
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-83982-84435 the your next promotion is sergeant eh so the the at that time everybody was like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-84469-84988 we must get the highest n s pay possible because n s pay is quite quite little lah so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-85013-85452 at that time i think the sergeant pay was like one thousand er
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-85532-85723 one hundred or two hundred yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-85809-86059 yah so is is quite a lot so everybody is like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-86196-86921 yah so i i was quite happy that at that day i graduate yes got corporal then my parents you know they came then they su rt me very happy
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-87522-87996 yah yah i i'm i'm sergeant uh now yah so just

S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-88666-89460 yah my i think for me to promote to the for me to change the the you know that the rank down here will take a bit longer ah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-89518-89747 yah but but it's okay lah i'm going to join them

S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-90440-90577 yes
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-90798-91385 hokay #chao keng# basically is uh from what i understand it's
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-91554-92338 you are su sed to do certain duties or you are su sed to you are expected to do certain things carry out certain tasks
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-92553-93084 because of er laziness or or whatever reasons that the person have right
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-93240-93495 either er feign illness you know
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-93519-93708 like wah i sick i go and see doctor
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-93741-94249 i get light duty get m c oh i got diarrheoa you know to basically just to avoid

S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-94624-94889 su sed to do lah so i think they have a
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-94951-95812 they have a very nice word for it called i think they call it mal~ malingering or something er yah yah yah that there's a term for that also yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-96162-97226 yah yah it i i i last time uh for period of time i i had that kind of mindset ah so that i fortunately i i managed to change ah because i think right if i i didnt ah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-97300-97607 even after n s right i think ah i'll still have this kind of
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-97629-97945 mindset yah then it will affect
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-97979-98200 my life also yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-98917-99121 like okay usually uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-99175-99480 uh okay i put a situation for you lah so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session1-2-99518-100133 like uh example in in during training uh okay kay we see we see this guy from
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-00142-00774 okay
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-01310-01922 uh no i don't stay in hall because yah i stay quite near to n t u so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-03034-03901 okay if you are at the s a c and you want to go to coffee-bean right okay you exit er s a c and
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-03926-04031 you
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-04247-04421 just walk straight down
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-04478-04670 you will pass by a
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-04705-04877 i think the printing
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-04909-05725 some printing shop to your right and then you walk just keep walking straight down you will pass by the bus that that convenience store
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-05802-06545 keep walking straight you uh that there'll be this like open plaza thing there's a giant t v down there you can't miss it
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-06736-06998 on the left i think there's booklink and
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-07041-08144 prime-supermarket i i can't remember what's on the right because yah i i know there's dunkin-donuts yah there's is so you just w~ walk straight down then there were uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-08224-09266 you that you can go to the l~ to your left or to your right but i think to your right is better because i usually take the to the r~ the path to the right so you just
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-09288-09688 turn right and then you turn left again and there'll be a long long path down
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-09746-10094 yah so you just keep walking down that path and
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-100014-100474 yah yah so we are a quite materialistic society
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-100621-100739 er
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-101014-101263 #abuden# #abuden# is like

S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-107869-108652 act blur is like pretending to not know something when you actually you know like you know like for example like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-108680-109293 er i was given assignment by my supervisor to do like this this

S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-127924-128227 ten minutes yah estimated ten minutes yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-128815-129317 yah sure yah alright right glad to help thank you
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-12986-14463 okay er #koufu# it is basically the same thing it's just you have to walk straight for a long time so uh what you do is uh you can either choose to take the elevator or you can choose to walk down the stairs so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-14499-14856 uh if you want to take the elevator you just need to
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-15149-15369 pass coffee-bean turn left
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-15436-15954 uh and then there'll be a row of like benches faced er to the side
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-16035-16268 of the path and then just walk down straight
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-16304-16843 and then there will be elevator so you just take the elevator down to the lowest level
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-16868-17231 i think eh is it lowest or second lowest
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-17256-17496 uh second lowest
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-17601-17820 and then you'll be
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-17909-18249 the bottom if you choose to take the stairs then you have to
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-18281-18473 walk out of coffee-bean
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-18531-19468 turn right you'll see like flight of like zigzaging not zipzaging ah but jagged stairs you know like so you just walk walk down the stairs all the way
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-19519-20379 so comparing those two areas right you you come down by the elevator you'll be like to the right side of the long path down the #koufu#
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-20401-20623 you come down by stairs you'll be on the left side
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-20684-21688 both are the same you just walk straight down and if you are on either side just walk straight down all the way you will pass by some l er l ts er
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-21718-22022 and then finally you will see uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-22066-22808 the #lee-kong-chian#-lecture-theatre the #lee-kong-chian#-l t there's like a very nice looking l t yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-22855-23048 so when you see that uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-23074-23561 you can there will be a s~ a flight of stairs down so just take the flight of stairs down
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-23612-23929 and then once you reach the end of the flight of the stairs you just
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-23979-24118 do a u turn
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-24278-24460 you will c~ you can see #koufu#
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-25152-25513 er #koufu# basically is like a
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-25617-25864 uh what what they call a a
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-25958-26451 um you want to say it's not a hawker centre but it's it's more of like a foodcourt
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-26470-26575 food court yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-26664-27774 so you you can see a lot of this uh around singapore uh in the shopping centres there there's like food-republic and and all that so #koufu# is actually one of those
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-27987-28385 companies ah that that operate foodcourts around so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-28463-29658 they did this kind of foodcourts they usually cater food to everyone's taste yah they try to cater to everyone's taste so that that that's why you see there's like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-29739-30286 there's like indian food there's like there's like malay food there's there's chicken-rice
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-30316-31294 chinese food there's the mixed-vegetable-rice you know got all the ingredients there and there's like noodles #laksa# western western food there's pasta there
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-31341-31463 and all that yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-33234-33448 okay er
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-33579-34177 i think a really nice one would be fried-rice
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-34216-34346 because uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-34479-34838 mo~ most of the time the the i think
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-34914-35312 the western uh students from western countries they they seldom have
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-35519-36138 like exposure to fried-rice e~ even if you know that there's like other exchange students from
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-36169-36648 from a~ other asian countries that there's like different varieties of
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-36676-37035 fried-rice so maybe the local one might might taste different
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-37056-37466 might have different taste because i myself i like to try like different varieties of
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-37501-37976 fried-rice there's there's no one type of fried rice there's so many types there's like uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-38015-38252 salted-fish-fried-rice there's like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-38277-38893 uh also i i can't even the recall there's there's just too too too many eh then there's like silver-fish-fried-rice
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-38939-39121 yah sil~ silver-fish is like
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-39186-39430 is is a
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-39664-41105 i i want to call it #ikan-bilis# but is but is not it is basically like a really small like white s~ fish you can eat you can eat the whole whole thing because they they fry and then it's so crispy you can just yah eat the whole thing
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-41299-41462 oh okay uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-41530-42276 the english word for #ikan-bilis# right is actually an anchovies yah so it is really just small fish that
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-42359-42922 uh how they cook it in the local style is that usually they will deep fried it
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-42945-43291 so it's really crispy you can just you know eat the whole thing and
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-43318-43570 yah it's very crunchy yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-43701-45229 uh i used to do that but now not really because it will give me like sore throat and all that so usually i have it with like um rice or or or usually they come they come with uh #nasi-lemak# yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-45281-46009 uh okay #nasi-lemak# is actually uh a malay cuisine malay food so uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-46037-46459 i think the literal translation is like i think #lemak# is
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-46494-47265 fat or something yah and and and #nasi# is rice so er why why there's f~ like #lemak# there's like fat i think is because of
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-47304-47893 they when they cook the rice they they cook it with coconut milk yah so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-47918-48421 there there's this like aro~ very nice aroma very nice uh smell in it
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-48463-49074 but but it's a kind of fattening so yah yah and and they they accompany the rice with
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-49290-49933 quite a few ingredients there's they accompanied with yah like what what i said just now #ikan-bilis# peanuts
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-50018-50759 uh fried chicken yah usually the fried chicken wing yah they taste really nice and sometimes they
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-50823-51246 they pair up with a fried fish the #ikan-kuning# yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-51758-52269 #ikan# means fish in malay yah so #kuning# is uh is a
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-52316-52860 type of fish yah it it it is i think it's around like this this big so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-52924-53952 usually they they fry it with like turmeric or something so so that it will look a bit like yea~ yellowy orangy yah but but it's really tasty because uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-54000-54894 yah it's deep fried yah yah yah and and the good thing about #nasi-lemak# also is er because it it comes with
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-54932-55120 #sambal# which is chilli
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-55162-56346 yah and and the chilli is like a there's a tinge of sweetness to it so you you mix around with it you can mix it around with the ingredients with the rice it it tastes good ah and and they end it off with
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-56377-57105 cucumber so af~ after you feeling wah really spicy and hot eh y~ y~ you can just eat the cucumber to cool yourself down
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-57105-57248 yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-57248-57524 yah yah i i eat that often
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-58146-58441 oh noodles okay uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-58514-58664 let's see
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-58900-59419 #mee-rebus# can can also be a good choice because uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-59560-59845 it is it's just yellow noodles uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-59872-62479 cooked in like i think in a some kind of like sweet sauce ah they they uh no i'm sorry they cook the noodles first and then i think they pour that sweet sauce thing over ah i i last time when i was i was young ah i used to drink the sauce yah it it's very like savoury but kind of fattening also at the same time ah yah and u~ usually uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-62611-62839 #mee-rebus# they they have
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-62950-63201 if i'm not wrong they have like uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-63226-63927 hard boiled egg inside oh yah i i forgot to say #nasi-lemak# also has egg but but it's fried egg yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-63958-65086 yah er for #mee-goreng# is boiled egg because i think it is not really er suit suitable to have fried egg in a soupy soupy dish yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-65148-66229 so they they will have like f~ a boiled egg and i think some some chicken in inside if i'm not wrong and they have like those like #tau-pok# small small
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-66286-66392 #tau-pok# inside
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-66471-67215 yah and and and they have like i think they put some veggies like i think is it coriander or s~ or something yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-67355-67771 the the v~ the veggies uh add abit of crunch
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-67834-68271 to the noodles and then add add a bit of like refreshing taste also
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-68355-68679 yah yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-69578-70052 okay uh indian food ah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-70245-70421 well uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-70640-71650 i think uh #nasi-briyani# you know ah it is a nice er indian food because i i eat that quite often
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-71866-72807 they they they have the same around the same name as er malay food like #nasi-briyani# i'm not sure why that's the case but
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-72837-73058 it's indian food but yah so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-73269-74428 the rice that they use is different from the the normal rice in #nasi-lemak# they use uh #basmati#-rice i think yah so it the grains of #basmati#-rice they are quite long
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-74533-75168 so they looked very unique ah they they the first time the first time when i saw them i saw it i thought it was
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-75257-75445 like uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-75789-76652 how to say #mee-siam# or or yah yah that was cut up really fine #mee-siam# is is a kind of like rice with er vermicelli then yah yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-76862-77678 it is rice that and they usually accompany with uh curry-chicken
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-77772-78690 er and if some some people they don't really like curry-chicken so they they can like have have the option of like fried chicken yah but but the thing is that
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-78755-79098 the chicken is so big yah especially when
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-79147-79410 when you have the drumstick
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-79449-79661 yah the drumstick is like so big
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-79811-80603 every time i i save it for the last you know i i slow slowly eat the rice because uh other than chicken they they have it with uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-80662-81096 sometimes they give you a piece of cracker yah uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-81141-81334 is is uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-81565-82575 i don't know what's that call but but that cracker has like some spices in it so when when you eat the cracker you know there's crunchy and then there's some spice taste inside yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-82637-83112 so i usually eat the rice with cracker then they have like some
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-83314-84037 salad uh what how i put it salad yah and some cucumber maybe some onions and all that
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-84082-84456 so #nasi-briyani# is the rice itself is quite
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-84685-85067 tasty already by itself you can actually eat it on it's own because they
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-85102-86041 they cook it with spices and and some other seasoning i am i i remember like i seen some kind of seed inside but i don't know what is it called
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-86101-86661 i think i saw star star-anise yah kind of like herb inside also so
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-86794-87247 some herbs and spices so the rice itself has quite a nice taste
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-89177-89367 alright uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-89388-89864 okay i might not know all of them so i i'll try to like explain everything
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-89898-90622 kay eleven-b er yah is is a national-service lingo basically eleven b is uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-90657-91597 identity card for all the full time national servicemen who who do their national-service as you know all male singaporean males aged eighteen they have to serve
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-91627-92761 yah their national-service so they'll be exchanging their identity cards with this particular er card by itself which identifies them as national servicemen ah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-93081-93351 yah four-d uh basically is uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-93468-93875 it's a kind of a betting er system in singapore uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-93904-94592 it it just means four digits i think because people usually line up at the the betting uh
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-94625-95276 betting place and then they usually placed their bets on like four numbers that that were open er every
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-95313-96603 wednesday saturday and sunday yah i i don't do that but i have like relatives will do that often so yah yah and five cs ah is a
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-96729-97331 is a local like slang for the five cs that
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-97405-98177 or a guy usually they they they refer to a guy ah who must have it in order to be successful or or to
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-98247-98732 or to like marry someone in singapore yah
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-98835-99040 yah yah a car
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-99066-99371 yah car is really expensive in singapore condominium
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-99404-99613 cash credit card
S1-mml-16-nov-2017-a-session3-2-99652-99882 and country club membership
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-00456-01049 oh i'm wei-en and i'm studying in chemistry and biological chemistry
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-01085-01208 currently year three
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-01664-02226 ah yes it's my first choice because i used to study chemistry in singapore-poly
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-02228-02478 yah so i continue on with the
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-02487-02599 same
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-02605-02861 same study yah same course
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-03209-03438 uh yes i
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-03488-03959 um because partly is i'm not interested in other fields
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-03969-04648 there are like engineering business so i'm more interested tend towards the science field yah so i chose chemistry
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-04885-05526 erm because i don't like physics yah from secondary school i knew i dont like physics and bio is
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-05538-05794 erm actually okay but
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-05827-06058 because chemistry is actually a mixture of
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-06155-06267 both of it
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-06392-06655 yah so i think chemistry is er
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-06736-06991 is preferred lah compared to those
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-07867-08175 subjects of modules ah erm
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-08206-08326 okay so
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-08354-08744 er in chemistry right we have a lot of different
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-08766-09248 er we will narrow down to different concentrations like let's say food chemistry
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-09252-09448 erm environmental
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-09470-10102 er medicinal yah chemistry so currently i'm more interested in food chemistry
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-10129-10953 yah so that's why i'm taking a concentration in food chemistry as part yah so will be taking more food modules
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-101544-102284 in may sixty eight or something we we went for the early bird price so its sixty eight for half marathon
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-102298-102669 yah and now i think is eighty plus or something already yah
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-102703-103008 yah yah yah the early bird thing yah

S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-19010-19660 um like for the er for the cows have nine stomachs because they will need to store their
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-19667-20065 food and then yah something something behind the
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-20211-21379 erm okay i kind of forgot already yah so yah er oh so the main thing is they have nine stomachs orh as compared to others because nice stomach is actually a big thing to yah to us yah something like that
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-21713-22183 er i'm not sure yah i'm not sure about the birds thing yah
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-22205-22331 yah

S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-24609-25438 and yah er that's for year one and year two so currently i'm in the another portfolio of that c c a
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-25471-26282 yah which is kind which called growth and o rtunities yah but so this one is more towards erm
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-26283-26600 erm er canvassing
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-26604-27387 and finding sponsorships for the c c a yah like exam welfare packs and all yah yah yah those kind
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-27411-27689 yeah so it's not much towards the
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-27704-27874 volunteering side
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-27885-28185 yah it's more of the s~ er
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-28310-28764 like emailing up to companies for sponsorships and everything yah yah
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-28907-29151 erm actually normally is
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-29173-29825 is easy to find sponsors it's just that er which kind of sponsor is good
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-29835-30214 er as in it's hard to find those good sponsors but it's easy to find sponsors
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-30218-30335 uh yah
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-30677-31219 oh cause we have we actually have a template so we just send yah so you just make sure that
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-31223-31545 erm like you make sure that the company is
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-31583-32273 the company that you send to right the name is correct ah the email and everything yah then that will be okay yah
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-32706-33276 erm oh besides that we have for like social impact week

S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-35885-36858 like maybe candy floss or popcorn or whatever yah so or bubble tea yah so best if we can find sponsors for them so we don't need to take up money from our own pocket
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-36865-37778 yah otherwise if no choice right then we might have to er like let's say use our funds yah to ask them to come over yah
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-38129-38960 er erm ya er okay er that time they had ben's and jerry's or something yah ben's and jerry's ice cream or something yah

S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-41321-41961 er not not really okay because they actually had a lot of portfolios right like let's say they had

S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-52108-52227 yah
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-52532-52882 yah yah it's actually quite busy for me especially this semester
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-52891-53267 because i overloaded my modules
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-53278-53472 yah because er
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-53495-54782 erm because i'm going exchange next sem so that's why i will need to overload like one more mod for this one yah so currently there are quite a lot of modules orh compared to the last few sems yah
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-54891-55011 sweden
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-55055-55216 yah
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-55245-55546 okay actually sweden particularly because erm
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-55555-56525 i thought that i could clear er business gerpe over there in that university but ended up they rejected the thing although they had previous records of
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-56536-58291 erm you can match that biz mod ya but this year they couldn't so that's why i erm and when they rejected the a ication right i was already accepted in the gem sweden thing yah so i have no choice orh so i just oh okay because other than that i'm okay with any other unis in europe
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-58685-59339 yah a business gerpe and also another of my er year four mod yeah so quite alot of the mods
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-59854-60429 it's because of that yah and i didn't know sweden would be so expensive actually initially so
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-60490-61385 i went to google right it's like among like the top top five or something because switzerland is the most expensive one then followed by norway
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-61396-61638 yah then around like sweden like that yah
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-61732-61862 um north europe
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-61921-62042 yah then
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-62059-63074 erm i'm i'm i'm also fine it with other europe places like let's say u k and all those yah but in the end like because of that module the business mod that's why i chose sweden
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-63091-64040 but also i think partly because actually still okay because my senior was in sweden last semester then he said okay sweden swedish people very nice
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-64079-64392 yah so okay orh at least yah
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-64811-65581 erm i don't know i think a lot of things that i didn't experience before like maybe let's say er
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-65618-65864 okay because i never been to erm
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-65900-66067 countries outside asia
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-66078-67465 yah and yah so i i didn't have the chance to experience winter as well then i heard from my friends that sweden right it can go down to the temperature can go down neg~ negative something like fifteen or something
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-67488-68541 yah then i'm abit scared lah because because i never experience winter before then yah then the first time we go there then it came down you know that they this kind of temperature so i'm not sure whether i can
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-68578-69392 adapt to it that's why i told my friends oh i'll be you know like wrap myself in a dumpling those kind yah
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-69757-70716 yah i don't think i er i don't know because sixteen all those fourteen right i'm already like shivering and all those but but i didn't wear those clothes ah so i'm not sure
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-70726-70950 yah er
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-71194-71612 erm next semester so it's
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-71658-72436 the school starts in end august so i'll probably be going off maybe early august but we haven't plan anything yet
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-72481-73114 yah because yah because we haven't plan anything like we wanted to go for a pre trip and all yah so
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-73145-74069 ah yes yes yah like we are planning to go to like iceland or something like many people they planning to go like iceland and road trip or something
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-74100-74400 yah yah yah it's super expensive
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-74446-75027 i guess people will because many people they go iceland cause it's very near each each each yah it's very near
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-75385-76046 er no as in sweden to iceland i think like can drive or something yah as in for iceland you have to drive ah
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-76084-77082 yah but people they say cause at that point in time right it's very cold like let's say the it's ice so my friends that time say it's very very dangerous because you have to go up
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-77084-77865 yah then it's very dangerous then because you have to go up and all then that time their car i think their their car ran out of petrol or something then they was stranded
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-77892-78681 yah so then they have to call the person the emergency thing yah somemore at the top of the mountain you know yah so
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-78760-79181 yah that's why then they they called the person then i think the person
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-79217-79631 like pulled the car or something like went yah
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-79640-79841 help to repair the car or something
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-80203-81344 yah yah that's right it's very dangerous yah especially when the road is slippery yah i will still go higher the the road is very slippery ah yah cause it's ice and everything yah
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-81552-81746 erm
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-81752-81995 i think er u k
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-82017-82243 yah u k and
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-82282-82542 not very sure maybe italy or something
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-82560-83975 yah haven't plan anything yet yah and and i am not familiar with the place with of of those countries because i've never been there before so i'm not sure yah prob~ probably i'll ask my friends for itinerary yah the itinerary yah
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-83997-84673 no as as in a few of them er as in like seniors and all yah so they went there before yah
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-84709-84820 yah thats why
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-85043-85707 erm initially we have quite a lot eh no as in in oh initially we have maybe like six seven
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-85712-86839 yah but ended up because that uni right we only had four places yah so erm three of us went in then the rest they uh one went to korea
S1-mml-21-mar-2018-b-session1-2-86853-87349 yah then some of them i think some of them went norway

S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-06689-07198 but uh i feel that it also because like my first two weeks it was like i was in the holiday mood
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-07211-07590 then i was like uh i just don't i just really don't feel like doing work so i just
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-07645-08033 yah so that's why i'm trying to catch up what what was left in week one and week two
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-08058-08503 so erm truly speaking week three isn't lot lah as of now yah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-08948-09180 right now i'm in the computer science
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-09190-09500 year one this is my semester two
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-09518-09867 so erm still learning the ropes about

S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-100230-100762 but but but the thing is that the the funny thing is that you know like before i come come to uni i'll be like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-100777-101737 okay lah i probably can notice the difference between the age you know like oh this person younger lah this person older but but i think when it come to <unk> it just doesn't think much about it

S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-102444-102766 sad
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-103404-103552 uh me ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-103631-103764 i don't think it was
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-103792-104232 okay i think the the purpose of army is definitely need necessary lah but
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-104234-104732 i don't i don't feel like i have get went through a positive change afterwards like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-104739-105301 like i i think it's like when you army you see a lot of those the ugly side of humans you know it's like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-105382-105552 you get a bit like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-105573-106088 some people you don't feel you do just don't trust ah like i i feel lah like in terms of
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-106225-106568 um like there are a bit of like backstabbing here and there you know
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-106586-107204 yah some politics here and then it's like you it's like it's so different from school school is like oh i'm friends with you because
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-10683-10909 so quite
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-107300-107523 like we are just friends you get what i mean like but
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-107558-108553 in army ah i'm friends with you ah because you can do this you can do that you get what i mean like or like i actually need you to do me do this somehow so it's like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-108565-108988 i don't know lah i feel that the the relationship there it's very hard
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-108999-109328 but eventually you will get it lah just takes
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-109330-109773 some detours here and there like this person can ah never mind next one you know that kind of thing
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-10950-11686 something that i am quite interested in ah because before that i i didn't know what i want when i first graduated from j c
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-109809-110082 yah but army was generally
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-110246-110394 er
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-110508-110633 how do i say ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-110831-111034 sometimes quite quite entertaining
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-111043-111325 but when you look back actually it felt like you have wasted the time
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-111350-111734 like in a way lah in a way like because like um
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-111842-112029 there are a lot of times we have to wait
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-112152-113139 uh mine is a i'm am a tank operator so uh it's like we only have that amount of tanks and there's only that number of tanks that go out so it's like very often we have to wait
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-113159-113599 so it's like the amount of wait time ah was actually very wasted like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-113629-113945 then they will rush us to wait like it's like it's the army thing ah eh
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-113956-114284 this time then you must reach earlier you know it's a good practice but
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-114288-114640 there are some times that it was way too early or like you know
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-114658-115057 where you know then you go there you still have to wait one it's not like gonna start immediately that kind of thing
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-115064-115642 yah but it's like that that amount of time was quite wasted lah i feel but erm
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-115649-115843 i can't really describe army much
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-115885-117543 like they are fun memories and afterwards you come out from army you have a lot of funny stories like of weird people inside like gonna okay before you go for me lah before i go into army i never thought that there will be weird people like people with weird behaviour not that they're different or what but they just behave differently
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-11691-11905 so um
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-117564-117664 then
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-117713-118329 it's like maybe for me i don't see that in my j c and my secondary school then like go to
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-118358-120558 army right then you will see those weird people and know some people that may not be weird but they are many weak minded like small thing there'll be like aiyah cannot do lah i don't want to already then they will drop out then they'll find excuses then the thing is that i don't like about them is that ah when they do that ah it's making more work for people because is like the amount of work is meant to be divided among that that that number of people which was intended like the plan it
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-12008-12449 what i did is that um when i first got up when i first got result i was so nervous and i was like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-120588-120768 the the higher ups plan it
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-120771-121432 but when the when those that came in they drop out here and there here and there wah the workload keep keep increasing like that so it's like ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-121564-121675 yah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-121690-122033 then also lah like sometimes i feel that
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-122058-122214 army wise
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-122216-122406 like the higher ups right
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-122447-123725 i don't know why it's like they will be like sometimes it's like you you done what was necessary what's in the plan and training then they will like wah you do too fast ah you a bit free let me think of what c~ i can give you to do so it's like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-123750-123892 you do things
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-123946-124194 so that you are occupied you get what i mean like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-124208-124456 i'm sure we have better things to do lah right
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-124458-125004 yah then it's like they will make us go clean the vehicle shed then it's like oh okay
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-12455-13510 don't know what to go don't know where to go so i just a y for any er science then uh in year two i thought um how about i try teaching you get what i mean so after i o r d i a ied for teaching internship
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-125136-125293 that was not part of the plan
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-125299-125655 but because we do too fast we got penalised for it so it's like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-125686-125803 wah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-125969-126094 yah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-13530-13976 then uh it was three months internship then after internship i realized that
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-13994-14881 teaching i'm interested but not being a teacher yah because being a teacher means much more than teaching itself like there are a lot of
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-14987-15716 yah you have to account to a lot of people like you have to account to for the student account for the the higher ups account to the parents
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-15725-16003 it it distracts you from teaching ah i feel so
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-16028-16449 i i thought that okay lah then try computer science yah so i was quite glad
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-17108-17392 no i didn't take any elective for this sem ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-17396-18011 cause last sem i overloaded then this sem i think there was this module that a lot of the seniors says
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-18027-18172 that it's very difficult
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-18190-18750 so i think about it lah no point rushing i mean right now i'm still at a normal workload mah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-18766-19211 so i can afford to for this sem i focus on a difficult one ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-19272-19374 yah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-19949-20143 uh during the internship
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-20162-20662 um i was given the o rtunity to teach sec two n a
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-20828-21152 and also uh sec three express chemistry
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-21170-21880 so uh that was that during the three pre~ three months i was given a chance to teach them prepare lesson plans and prepare the notes
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-21885-22563 and actually conduct lesson lessons with them with my mentor at the back to observe and also to give comments afterwards
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-22585-22975 then er right now i'm actually still uh giving tuition
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-22986-23475 so uh we started like last year january or dec~ or last last year december
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-23479-24050 so it was this student that i was teaching f~ uh he's a primary six student from uh what's that called
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-24153-24901 nanyang primary yah nanyang-primary-school so uh she just had er p s l e last year then right now i'm teaching her sec one
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-24906-25282 and the mom was very enthusiastic lah like i would say
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-25292-25716 like soon after p s l e even before november she she asked me
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-25729-25902 jing-wei are you ready to start
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-25975-26088 tuition then i was like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-26195-26376 yah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-26493-27195 it it was one of the most #kiasu# but yah it's good f~ good for me ah i mean if she insists then alright lor
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-27648-28052 it was in a secondary school it was in uh dunearn-secondary-school
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-28331-28788 it was at by right okay right now it's at bukit-batok area
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-28798-29324 but before that it was at boon-lay because they were waiting for their new compound school compounds to be built
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-29330-29860 so it was a temporary site it was at boon-lay only so it's like yah so for a period of time last sem
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-29864-30168 i reseeing my old students so i was like #aiyah# so awkward
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-30175-30336 no it's like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-31436-31835 nanyang primary that one is actually uh that one is tuition
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-31855-32249 yah so tuition part is i got from my friend his his sister
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-32260-32630 so yah that one is not related to the school that i was teaching ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-32633-33009 yah that one is the the one that i thought was at the dunearn-secondary-school
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-33517-33696 uh from secondary school right
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-33722-33905 we're not allowed to contact them so
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-33932-34459 it is like you know they are saying kay don't have any contact but you know some some student still add you on instagram
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-34477-34602 got lah but
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-34631-34974 um better i feel that never mind i better not you know
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-35044-35161 yah like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-35172-35518 i don't know i <unk> like can't get through myself ah you get what i mean
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-35585-35818 so never mind ah so i teach
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-35840-36013 their student is enough for me lah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-36549-37128 actually looking at it i just started looking for it yah at i first that one uh the one i was teaching
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-37135-37478 uh it was enough because like she wanted two times a week
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-37515-38748 then i was like ppp okay lah two times a week is already you know at my limit there i was like okay is enough for me to get all my life but now she wants one times a week which is also alright so i thought okay never mind lah i just get another student
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-38800-39056 yah can also get a type of experience mah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-39074-39514 so right now i'm looking but er it takes some time for tuition agencies to find
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-39528-40654 they will what they'll do is that you register say what you want your preferences your region and then they uh your rates and everything then when the parents actually asked for assignments as in ask for tutors ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-40666-41131 they will actually classify and see okay this suits what you're looking for then they will sent to you
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-41142-41526 like you must be suit you and also the er
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-41536-42592 the family is other client ah yah still waiting yah but male tutor a bit hard lah they all want like you know female tutor er to them it's safer lah i mean
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-42706-42807 yah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-42851-43090 so it's okay lah see how
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-43163-43294 correct correct
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-43349-43668 i think same lah i mean younger and older also worse lah right
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-43705-43829 yah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-44273-45077 yah but i i mean if you were if you are parents you'll probably want a female tutor over male tutor isn't it or is there no preference
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-45338-45802 doesn't really matter if it's daughter then different lah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-46235-46463 um different generation ah different generation
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-47205-47393 uh yah correct that
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-47573-47815 ten plus years i su se like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-47866-48352 kay let's say yah i think around there lah not quite old lah correct lah like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-48446-48678 um
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-48707-49097 yah i i agree on that like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-50244-50893 actually right i'm hoping that you know singapore will actually focus more about uh programming part
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-50906-52382 like uh maybe i heard that j c has com compute like programming stuff so if let's say they actually offer that in j c i wouldn't mind teaching j c kids cause j c kids is the the time spend is more worth it you get what i mean like in terms of pay per hour
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-52423-53045 yah but the thing is that computing programming wise lah a lot of things can be found online
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-53110-53627 yah like khan-academy code academy all all those there's a lot of free stuff online so
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-53683-54174 erm but depends ah some parents they still want people to talk to the kids you know so
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-54204-54311 see how it goes
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-54936-55122 school
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-55228-55929 really hard lah but i hope lah i hope they will they will focus more on that i mean since they they say that they want more computer science people then
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-55951-56091 it will help lah i mean
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-56108-56382 right now it's an like when i join this course
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-56390-56748 uh my friend was also say eh you're you're putting yourself at disadvantage because
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-56753-57309 uh my coursemates right some of them are from j c but a lot of them are from poly
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-57321-57985 then those people from poly of course their course that they study was somewhat related to programming lah otherwise they wouldn't be here
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-57990-58214 so uh yah they're quite good
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-58222-58330 but
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-58335-58492 see how it goes lah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-59001-60222 yah for for u~ u~ university specific wise lah i feel they get exemption eh then it's like wah we overload like don't know what ah they still like eh take more take their time cause they got a lot of exemption
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-60491-60646 oh really
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-61004-61366 that that means they actually didn't waste their time you get what i mean like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-61541-61747 still even now what like you know
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-61850-62000 unless i mean
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-62026-62210 but it's not easy lah because
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-62216-62438 to get from poly to here
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-62441-62566 they are very good
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-62572-62685 they're very good eh
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-63008-63188 so what course are you in like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-63350-63744 oh linguistics hey so you had to came come all the way from h s s and stuff

S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session1-2-99248-99825 i i think for your case it's more of the older spectrum right like you'll this person so much older ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-02871-03039 is it are you asking right now
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-03349-03549 to get from north spine to hive
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-03582-04227 kay right now we're at b4 of computer science block so what you can do is that you just take a lift
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-04250-04478 up to the first floor
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-04544-04724 then um
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-04834-05511 walk out of this block itself then when you walk out of this block you turn left and walk straight all the way
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-05526-05845 you will soon see a nanyang-auditorium or
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-05880-06300 a coffee-bean i think at that point of time it's very easy for you to ask someone that was there
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-06309-06462 then um
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-06612-06908 to get to the hive erm
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-06975-07261 you can just pass by the starbucks
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-07336-07637 and walk down the st~ f~ er a long flight of stairs
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-07694-08033 then uh walk straight you were eventually seeing a lecture hall
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-08052-08357 i think it's a me~ what i can't remember the name
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-08440-09097 but that lecture area is very iconic like it has big panels of glass
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-09120-09555 kay so that that is very iconic so uh so when you see the
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-09580-09769 um lecture right
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-09789-10422 you just turn right you will see a staircase that leads down so you just go down the staircase
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-100204-100352 oh my god
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-103745-103928 um what singaporeans do ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-104071-104370 oh singaporeans like that always like to do this one thing
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-104383-104647 the first thing they see a queue they will queue
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-104651-105104 they won't ask sir what are you queuing for they won't ask they see a queue
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-10473-10696 then afterwards you go around the staircase
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-105123-105757 the first thing that comes to my mind is not to ask is that um there must be g~ free and good stuff
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-105778-105975 cause that's all singaporeans are all about free
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-106021-106558 okay so it's like they will just queue queue queue then at the end of when they reach the start of the queue ah they'll be like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-106572-106818 er sorry ah what what are we queuing for ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-106824-106982 then they'll get what they want
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-106983-107532 hm then they will leave satisfied but sometimes they they'll be a bit angry ah because they queue for nothing but they deserve it
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-10717-10874 um
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-107542-108347 so um they also like to some some weird behavior that singaporeans do is that they also like to use um their own singlish
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-108398-108601 so um
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-108845-109018 as you grow up
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-10900-11028 make a u turn
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-109021-109281 you were exposed to different type of
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-109298-109402 singlish
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-109410-109578 so let's say primary school
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-109590-109783 primary school ah what they know ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-109786-109955 is they will know #buay-tahan#
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-110041-110175 they will know
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-110189-110319 um
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-110457-110817 come i clap for you they will say confirm plus chop
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-110941-111505 then when you level up ah so as in when you go j c or secondary school
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-111546-111796 what they like to say ah is #chio-bu#
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-11188-12220 i don't know how to describe that but you may look around at that floor at that yah at that floor you will see koufu see koufu right walk straight walk straight down the f~ you will see a flight of stairs walk straight again
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-111951-112138 then they also like to say b g r
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-112231-112410 then they also like to say #bojio#
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-112497-112895 so all these right um just a quick explanation
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-112916-113033 #bojio#
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-113050-113195 is like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-113203-113547 i didn't ask you to join me so it's like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-113550-113697 um
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-113724-114074 they felt left out so that's why they say #bojio# they want to be invited
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-114100-114259 so for #bo liao#
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-114274-114509 is that nothing better to do
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-114550-115338 yah so then uh #chio-bu# it is the hokkien way of calling someone
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-115363-115660 that is pretty but actually it's very rude
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-115698-116385 then uh come i uh what's that ah what ah come i clap for you right it's like er
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-116390-117070 being sarcastic like i don't really want to clap for you but i'm saying it so you feel entertained so and confirm plus chop is like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-117127-117301 let's not ask what they're gonna chop but
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-117314-117880 it's just to say that i'm very sure that it is the case even if i have to bet things
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-117919-118065 that involved chopping
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-118166-118391 then uh
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-118456-118732 let's just go through this list of singlish
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-118746-119044 cause i guess singlish is a very big part of singaporeans
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-119071-119366 so um just
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-119405-119551 uh #abuthen#
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-119568-119684 is like
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-119995-120606 the more popular say is like you don't say so it's like it's like it's a given like you should have known it
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-120654-121022 uh eleven-b is um the pass that
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-121031-121614 uh we have to ho~ men have to hold on during their national-service for the rest of their life
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-121657-122208 and uh for the first two years they will be finding something else not the eleven-b but the pink i c
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-122248-122402 that a lot of people take for granted
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-12229-12435 then afterwards um
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-122418-122650 but uh anyway and the five-cs
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-122666-123230 erm doesn't concern me uh okay it <unk> not concern me uh fine but uh what is it ah condo credit card
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-123782-124064 i don't know lah but the five-cs mayb~ do you know
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-124072-124636 i don't know also okay but anyway um #ah-beng# #ah-lian# right is like the equivalent of
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-124656-124983 um male gangster and female gangster
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-124984-125157 #ah-kua# means
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-125318-125790 a bit sensitive let's not talk about it because you are conservative then uh
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-12566-13206 walking forward when by the time you reach the lower floor of koufu i think you will be able to see
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-125858-126144 #an-zhua# right it means that what's up
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-126197-126308 in english ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-126353-126468 #ang-moh#
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-126486-126931 kay lah sometimes you also don't call #ang-moh# but #ang-moh# refers to caucasian
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-127032-127210 um
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-127269-127435 itchy backside ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-127522-128132 it's not really doesn't mean that your backside is itchy doesn't me your buttocks is itchy it means that
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-128257-128402 you did something
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-128516-129008 that was necces~ not necessary and end up you have to pay the consequences
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-129015-129121 i i think
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-129133-129383 so uh g g
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-129439-129991 depends on the context they're saying g g if you say in a game it means good game
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-130169-130516 if you say to others that did something wrong
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-130530-130786 eh you g g already it means that
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-130831-131070 good game also good game but
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-131106-131289 in a way it means that
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-131297-131428 um
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-131467-131607 you're in deep shit
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-131639-131748 so
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-131771-132248 uh but if you say that you can also say i am g g home
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-132313-132582 it can also be interpreted i'm gonna go home
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-13233-13444 uh you know the #dimsum#
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-132849-133011 it depends on the context
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-133076-133206 uh
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-133579-133780 then erm
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-133886-134104 okay then also shag
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-134169-134388 shag means tired
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-134497-134791 but it means something else on the dictionary lah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-13468-13632 the #dimsum# thing right
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-135269-135471 they will use that in their complaints
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-135480-135620 wah this one damn shag
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-135662-137111 then you like add a damn so that it amplify because it's like apparently shag is not enough they must put damn shag so it's like yah so shag is like after you do something wah i feel damn shag it can be it is like i feel damn shag is like er noun
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-13653-13816 the #dimsum# basket
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-137116-137264 then this is
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-137408-137539 this shag me out
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-137557-137751 also can be used as a verb so
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-137791-137970 uh depends on how you want to use it ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-13852-14188 yah you the hive looks like that so just walk towards there
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-14199-14327 but don't take the lift
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-14396-14543 because the lift is very bad
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-16218-16371 outside of n t u
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-16596-16728 not too far

S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-38773-39553 hm honestly i don't recommend though uh but er i think boon-lay is good enough honestly like they have quite a number of
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-39675-40147 clothes but but if you are willing to go further go to like suntec harbourfront
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-40166-41385 uh i mean vivocity lah harbourfront those are the bigger malls uh if you want a street wear go bugis street or some place you can sort or place that you can go is at the cit~ tanjong pagar there what is that place called ah
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-41543-42215 i can't remember what's that place city-plaza is it i think city-plaza but what i know is that that plaza has arnold-chicken
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-42254-42780 if you know that ah then yah that one actually sell quite a number of their i think they're retailers
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-42827-43202 and they sell mostly female clothes so eh i think it'll be quite suitable for you
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-43896-44221 er boon-lay one er i assume you already know
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-44224-44614 so uh to get to the
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-44642-44819 bugis street is
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-44824-45319 just take uh the green line in your case from boon-lay all the way to bugis
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-45346-45680 or if you want to go suntec you can also take a bus from
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-45837-46824 to suntec straight away or you can walk from there if you want ah miss it's very near then uh if you want to go harbourfront uh you probably have to
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-46906-47593 take to the buona vis~ buona vista and then just take the line straight down to harbourfront it's the last station
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-47657-47913 yah i think that's reasonably close lah so
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-48341-48987 tanjong-pagar tanjong-pagar is erm it's a little bit bef~ it's a few stations before
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-49002-49904 um bugis so from boon-lay to tanjong-pagar is nearer then going to bugis because the tanjong-pagar is in between tanjong um boon-lay and
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-51040-51155 i don't drink eh
S1-mml-29-jan-2018-a-session3-2-51184-51880 i dont party also so i don't know but um if i really have to recommend you um

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-01929-02417 uh i'm having a class erm right before this um session
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-02432-02647 so i was at the
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-02673-02858 er south spine
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-02986-03222 having um i accounting lesson
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-03408-03611 erm i in accountancy
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-03914-04072 er year two sem two
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-04487-04922 uh yes it is my first choice because erm
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-04932-05634 when i was in poly i was doing business admin so it's quite a general erm course
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-05643-06076 so from there i start to realize like what i actually like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-06094-07197 because i tend to get to try different areas of business so after trying i realised that eh financial accounting is something i like because it is very erm
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-07209-07323 clear like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-07373-07861 once you get it you get it not unlike the rest of the module like erm
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-07890-09213 a bit fluff i feel so i was like esh is this correct or is this wrong very subjective so i thought that ah accounting is what i want so when i was here in uni year one i realize that er it's a bit
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-09229-09463 different from what i expected
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-09490-09602 so yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-09715-09906 uh how is it different
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-09992-10301 what i learnt is way too in depth already
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-100007-100744 what we do in poly also but not that difficult but yah we also did like a lot of practice like you know all the things
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-100848-100976 so yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-101641-101971 i prefer working just that that experience is like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-101999-102217 yah totally different
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-102244-102806 but the thing about that i prefer i decide what makes me erm decide to
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-102822-103684 erm go on to financing er to accounting now it's also because i feel that after that three years in poly i didn't really learn much is
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-10345-10770 too much calculation and yah that's all that
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-103709-103972 the uh that time i remember a year three
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-103997-104788 uh before we like erm decided where we want to go like either work or continue a ying for uni erm
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-104800-105274 uni so we were sitting down in a group then we're like er okay
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-105306-105613 so what we actually learn from this whole
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-105655-106449 whole erm poly education then we were like don't know eh i think do nice presentation so we don't have like really a very
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-106473-106672 confident answer like oh
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-106680-107263 our steps is okay we learn statistic so okay we can use that our excel is very good you know
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-107265-107779 like skills part a bit we have no idea what to put there also
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-107781-108902 so this is what makes me like think that i need to go on to something that erm is more specialised so that i know that after i graduate okay this is
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-109016-109200 yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-109948-110496 that time i was like sixteen seventeen so i know i want to do into this industry like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-110617-110933 the general <unk> more general costs
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-110960-111233 you don't have to make decision on like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-111273-111783 where to go or what you want to do so we can get to try different style
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-112186-112648 uh yah i didn't want to make a choice then
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-112774-113781 if now i were to go back to that time or advise another person at my age i think is good to
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-113865-113983 think through it
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-114047-114183 because at the end
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-114195-115290 you unless you really know that oh you like marketing like all these to learn all these skills then you feel that it's very er subjective ah some people feel it's good because it force you to`
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-11431-12449 even though i have a lot lots of complain about this but i still love it lah like i can see myself doing it erm after i graduate
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-115314-115425 be more
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-115431-116821 er there's a lot of presentation for my course so we tend to work with different groups so we are very used to like working with different people er for every sem and every mod we work with different people so
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-116854-117555 even if changing environment or what it doesn't really affect us we can like adapt easily so i think this is one of the take away from my
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-117561-117881 course other than that i think
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-118182-118342 yes yes
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-12477-14352 because uh after i graduate i tend i plan to continue in this industry and also continue to see how i can improve myself in that area like see what i'm lacking in like the skills or what l'm lacking so i can continue to upgrade myself even after i graduate from
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-15129-16072 erm i don't really have a club that i joined but er i tend to take up like classes outside like previously during erm
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-16124-16306 my summer break
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-16337-17034 before that uh before this sem i was actually doing my erm internship i took an l o a so
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-17040-18421 while i was working erm from nine to six like during the weekend and after work i tend to have a lot extra time because unlike school we don't have to like erm bring work back home to do or what so i have more times
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-18428-18908 that's the time where i start to like erm learn more about other things like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-18941-19042 er
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-19044-19160 insurance
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-19173-21272 i go for classes like to see like how come there's so many people so interested in this industry so i go for their classes which is like erm you don't have to pay up for anything but you just go for the lesson to have a feel to understand more about what people are actually talking about so that's what i tend to spend during my leisure time
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-21890-22983 at the start because it is six month erm internship it is my first time working for so long so at the start i still very feel very you know i enjoy and like you know erm
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-22989-23324 because t g i f is really t g i f
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-23358-23622 ya damn weekend you really like rest
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-23798-24727 erm starting really after three months right you start to feel a bit nine to six is like too long already even if you got nothing because erm
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-24744-26476 uh during working hours right you tend to have like sometime it's off peak hour so you have like erm more time for yourself but you still have to stuck in that office you know you have non like you cannot go anywhere you cannot keep visiting the pantry or the toilet so you <unk> just have to sit there then you realize that
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-26552-26854 when you knock of that time is already like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-26869-27091 uh the sun already set
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-27120-28376 so you like you miss you really miss the sun you know like because in the morning like eight plus i will reach office then i think i will go out around twelve plus so that's the only time you get to feel the sun
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-28931-29411 yes yes otherwise you are like trap in that office like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-29900-30042 yes yes yes
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-30097-31883 so right now is like even though you have lots of time like because i arranged my time table in the way that i only attend class in the morning i prefer morning class so after twelve plus i have my time like on time but you have to allocate time to your revision and all those catching up with the assignment all those
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-32573-34306 okay like for the class because erm like for one module i'll only attend like they make it in a way like we only attend class for three hours in a week yah so lesser time lesser class er seminar but more readings ah yes more time yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-34313-34637 to do reading yes own own revision
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-36257-36525 no i take like forensic science
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-36575-36676 er
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-36713-36960 interesting i don't think
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-37042-38047 it is interesting because you tend to learn way more than what you can absorb so at the end of the class you feel that oh you are overwhelmed by all the information
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-38281-39105 what i find it interesting after finals then yah you start to recall back what you learn then okay ah still quite fun like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-39131-39344 but during that erm
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-39430-39987 semester itself you have lots of things to cope so you don't really feel like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-40081-40439 ya ya
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-41423-41832 volunteered stuff i volunteered in c d a c
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-41852-42217 er some um c d a this uh
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-42246-43381 place where we tend to help like uh teaching the primary school the um less fortunate primary school student like in tutoring them in their work or what so there is once
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-43389-44070 er we actually have this you know every year we have these erm at the start of the year we have these erm seminar
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-44080-45613 prepared for secondary uh poly student darren and and themselves uh the student themselves so what this seminar is about is that to prepare them on what poly life is about because on from secondary school to poly a bit different
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-45616-46429 so we tend to like share with them what er they weren't ex expect from this uh education
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-46447-46636 and no erm
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-46682-47687 yah to prepare themselves ah so i get the o rtunity to erm be the emcee for that seminar yah so i think that is the a very
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-47808-48015 memorable experience for me
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-48144-48380 too um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-48751-48959 on and off on and off yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-49269-49526 travelled anywhere i like thailand
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-49560-49677 yah is
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-49699-49895 um within my budget
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-49961-50351 but at the same time it still can you know travel out of singapore
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-50388-50650 yes yes yes yes
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-51485-51697 i think is the people
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-51699-51854 um like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-51878-52007 you can feel like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-52022-52604 when you are shopping the shopping is not the main thing is that how you interact with the seller
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-52619-52804 like they are always so
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-52865-53285 excited about something i don't know like you can feel that their
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-53299-53591 the level of energy they have is like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-53610-54683 very high then i'm like are they always like that because in singapore you tend to see that people are more focusing on their cellphone or they just follow you around but you they are a bit
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-54765-54934 they don't look that
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-54992-55626 excited or passion about your arrival or anything they just oh you are here okay then er anything but
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-55632-56630 in thailand they will tend to i think it's the way they speak or what their tone is very high so you feel that uh their energy level is so high then you feel you can feel their
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-56669-56876 what are their excitement also
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-57328-57445 ah yes
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-57498-58694 that's what i'm thinking like er in year three i need to clear like erm two more u e so i'm thinking of either thai or korea korean language this two
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-58858-59491 wah so you clear what the level one level one for both which one you think it's manageable like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-60391-60503 um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-61034-61250 the wording right
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-61294-61616 um how you learn like you memorize or you just
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-62469-62582 um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-63614-63717 um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-63947-64363 oh like all the words just keep throwing at you er i see
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-65212-65399 okay
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-65494-65917 so you think after level one of two both the language korean and thai right
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-65943-66180 can you like a y it in like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-66184-67002 in real life like you can you speak like proper like okay bit and pieces here and there like when people speak to you can you like understand a bit
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-67298-67419 oh
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-67982-68082 um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-68647-69298 so you plan to continue which one like you prefer which one like if you were to take a level two
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-69491-69829 kor korea wow
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-71240-71387 easier to re

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-73897-74034 yes
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-75401-75561 places i want to work
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-75627-75988 not much on that but places i want to visit any place like

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-76855-77057 away from city hm
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-78147-78549 either korea japan or taiwan these three
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-79166-79373 yes yes
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-79995-80201 i feel i not sure i think
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-80241-80372 er because
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-80403-80588 europe all these places like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-80638-80869 a bit distant like i don't feel er
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-80899-81042 erm
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-81084-81295 i don't feel a bit uh like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-81313-81525 i can't relate to them i feel
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-81577-82461 yah but for asia wise i think our culture and the food we eat and all those i not sure i think i can relate better
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-82651-82767 yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-83687-84970 oh another thing is uh i prefer using chopstick yah i need chopstick in like you know every meal or what like even if i'm eating rice then they are like eh how come you don't want to use a fork and spoon i'm like urgh
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-84987-85314 chopsticks is good yes
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-85829-85943 um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-86260-86374 yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-87785-88062 it depends eh like for me like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-88088-88420 if i'm on my own i'm okay with anything
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-88449-88770 but i tend to follow the majority
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-88795-89409 ha depends on what people want to eat then i just okay i don't have a erm preference or what yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-89456-89574 no
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-91358-91636 poly um i think poly
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-91776-92187 for my course right it's different from i didn't know
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-92217-94390 this difference until i erm graduate from poly so this is what happened uh during poly uh for my course i'm doing business admin so we focus a lot a lot on like those marketing soft skills representation uh as compared to banking finance and accounting course they are more erm
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-94408-96780 book related like <unk> ah they emphasise heavily on finals like their paper but for us it's like our a huge percentage is focused on our presentation so we our lecturer will keep telling us like no the slides must be like er a lot of animation as dramatic as possible you know our presentation is like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-96798-97382 we need to perform in class one to entertain like there's entertainment erm
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-97527-97889 marks yah component in that presentation so
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-97928-98248 i thought that you know i at school is poly is like that
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-98290-98655 yah so that's why that's why i was i keep saying like when
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-98673-98932 i entered uni the difference it's like wah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session1-2-99005-100004 so different until i spoke to like erm my er accounting and banking finance erm peers then they are like er actually this is something
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-02876-05032 i think erm nearby would be boon-lay uh what's that mall actually i cannot remember but you can travel like erm take er travel out from the school compound and take a train to boon-lay station unlike otherwise you can alight at er jurong east also i think that would be an ideal place to shop because there are a few more shopping malls
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-05056-06154 yah oh i remember boon-lay there is this jurong-point but in jurong-east there are i m m er and a few malls over there that you can visit
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-07448-07820 uh i think the more popular places that people know
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-07823-09113 where they sell fashion apparels are in bugis area erm uh orchard there's this er fly far-east-plaza otherwise the <unk> the other place you can visit is at this uh
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-09157-09271 where's this place
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-09350-09548 uh the city-plaza
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-09577-09776 yah so i think there is
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-09786-11442 because people know that <unk> that place is where uh no all the blog shop will get their su ies from they tend to sell uh in huge quantity if so if say you want to buy something some clothes in huge quantity that is a very ideal place to get your clothes
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-100827-101633 so if we say erm #aiyoh# don't like that lah give face a bit eh it means that now don't embarrass the person
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-101645-101763 and like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-101808-102603 don't point out he her flaws or his flaws like in public places yah so this is what give face means
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-102883-103641 it's also very erm it's something we use very frequently and it's very convenient like is it is it means that
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-103720-103849 is this true
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-103940-104714 uh yah so if when you want to like see if something is it real or authentic or what then we just say is it
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-104850-105297 and #jialat# is also a word that you will often
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-105329-105543 hear people using it
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-105583-105847 #jialat# is like oh no but
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-106007-106282 it make it sound make that situation
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-106314-106599 sound more worse than it is
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-106717-107441 so you can feel when someone use the word #jialat# you can feel you can you need to know you need to be aware that
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-107568-108528 the situation is like out of control that's why these words will appear and as you know a singaporean are always very you know
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-108571-109057 a hec- in a hectic lifestyle so we are always very #kancheong#
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-109144-109289 so this word
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-109333-110082 if you want to say like how you can also like include this in your question like why you always so #kancheong#
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-110175-110480 erm maybe the way they speak
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-110501-110672 or erm
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-110742-111294 the way they do their stuff it or they the way they finish their meal like eat yeah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-111403-111555 and
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-111726-112034 <unk> other than that i think er
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-112121-112283 #chinchye# is
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-112295-112401 when
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-112548-112725 will be used when
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-112782-112930 a person reach
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-112952-113563 his maximum capacity then they will be like #aiyah# #chinchye# lah whatever
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-113706-113842 so this is
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-113911-114093 erm used when
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-114108-114382 we realise the situation is
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-114417-114690 too much to handle overwhelming
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-114756-114859 and
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-114874-115533 something which the student will often encounter in classes is that they catch no ball
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-115631-115918 the erm prof would be like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-115922-116703 telling his stories or delivering his class while we are in our the student are in their own world
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-116736-117018 and not knowing what's going on
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-117045-117208 so yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-117225-117341 this is what
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-117351-117661 happen if the lesson is too #cheem#
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-117839-117953 and
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-118057-118343 we will use the word #cheh# when
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-118556-118774 okay this is what happens if
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-118817-119502 person a describe something you very significant like we expect something huge from it
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-119522-119622 en
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-119629-120159 the reality is no it is not they will be like #cheh# like that only
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-11997-12670 from boon-lay m r t you can travel all the way to towards erm
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-120249-120458 it shows that we are very disa inted
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-12743-13233 changi erm that side ah so you alight at
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-13301-13497 eh let me take a look
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-13696-13838 oh okay
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-14015-14284 so this map is a bit messy
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-14438-14809 uh you can oh you alight at paya-lebar now i remember
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-14816-15001 so you alight at paya-lebar
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-15012-15599 then you will need to walk a few more distant before you can reach city-plaza
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-15604-15779 so from
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-15810-15919 er
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-15958-16094 here erm
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-16187-16357 pioneer you can
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-16369-16775 travel to boon-lay then take circle line or all the way
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-16802-17112 to paya-lebar with the green line
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-18230-18620 uh recommend you to go i think you can travel to yishun
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-18630-18913 because yishun sembawang is a newly developed
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-18936-19252 area estate so you can
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-19259-19652 travel there and it is also very near to
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-19676-19812 woodlands checkpoint
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-19845-20389 so you can um once you are there you can decide if you want to go
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-20404-20548 out of singapore
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-21874-22259 i think if you want to go to somewhere erm out of the city
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-22298-22555 erm east-coast-park is good
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-22727-23109 besides erm taking train i think
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-23132-23407 it's better to travel by bus
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-23414-24137 so you can alight at er yio-chu-kang station and take the bus there's a few bus you can take
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-24152-24557 once you reach that station so you can look at the
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-24588-24950 directory and see like where to alight
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-24985-25657 and yah i prefer erm taking bus to
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-25672-26949 er taking this train is because erm bus you get to see more things and you have more personal space as compared to train like in train you would sit inside the train you are like facing
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-26962-28350 uh the o site side of the people so so sometimes you feel a bit uncomfortable so we tend to look either out of the window or on er at your phone but bus is different like you just everybody is facing the front
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-28377-28560 so yah more
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-28589-28695 privacy
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-29518-29708 um other parts
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-29722-29983 i think pasir-ris park is good
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-30077-30758 and once you at pasir-ris not only there is this park you can also visit their
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-30772-31063 erm facilities like the wild-wild-wet
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-31152-31982 which just i think it just open and there are also other like erm chalet for you to stay with your family and
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-31999-32216 have a barbecue session over there
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-32256-32435 so i think that is a very good
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-32639-33237 short getaway from you know your daily life and to
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-33246-33619 have a gathering with your family or friends
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-34625-35062 i think night life for night life is also town eh but i would think
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-35080-35445 actually erm going to harbourfront sentosa is good
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-35481-35609 yes because
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-35617-36284 vivo-city is huge like you can there's a lot of food for you to erm visit also then
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-36352-36517 uh other than that
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-36525-36668 once you like
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-36744-37953 out of the shopping mall you can like take a walk or by cable car or drive into sentosa and you know have a different experience of that area also
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-38556-39156 you can travel all the way to er using circle line to outram
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-39175-39920 then you alight and take the purple line and or you will reach there around like forty five minute you will reach harbourfront
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-39995-40808 so it's very convenient with the line on our transport system yah so we can reach any place you want
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-41603-42030 the recently i just erm yah as what i mentioned er sentosa
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-42058-42209 because erm
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-42409-42586 that is a very uh
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-42944-43196 i just went there because uh
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-43299-44064 of the clean beach and yah then we can have other activities over there also like the fountain turn

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-46103-46523 yes so i think that is a place that which i want to visit one day
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-46564-46845 because i haven't get to visit one
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-46884-48237 so i think this also yes yes yes i am an animal cafe so you can go there and because as compared to zoo zoo is just get to see the animal but for dog cafe you can get to interact with the pets over there

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-89883-90138 i think er today is a very
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-90171-90510 warm weather so i would like to have a #chin-chow#
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-90632-90793 with more ice
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-90873-91009 and takeaway
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-91327-91489 okay thank you
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-93981-94214 i think erm
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-94268-94599 them usual work we will
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-94608-94968 <unk> we singaporean will say is um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-95656-96586 like erm maybe the place is too warm and we want to increase the temperature of the aircon we won't say like air conditioner or what we just say air con
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-96610-96815 yah and
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-96994-97445 if we got additional stuff or what then we will say like extra
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-97488-98060 so extra can mean a lot of thing like you aren't to describe a person
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-98070-98335 it means that that person is
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-98360-98791 not necessary to be here you know he or she her present
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-98938-99272 redundant so we also um call the extra
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-99378-99617 and for erm
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-a-session3-2-99856-100812 so for asian culture we focus we emphasise a lot of er giving this thing called give people face like give face
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-01476-02020 um okay i'm currently i'm hong-dah studying uh mechanical engineering year one

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-02879-03070 um actually
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-03087-04160 because my a-level result wasn't that good then i didn't have a goal in mind to choose what course also so it's like engineering is the safest path you know the options to broaden my options
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-04458-05356 erm yup i do have a friend in mech eng~ graduated already he's in mech engine ah then he also advised me that if i not very sure just choose engineering

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-06369-07611 oh okay so actually we are part of a grassroot youth club so we organise a lot of activities so we do community service projects so one example is we do organize tutoring programme for children from

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-109282-109606 i think it's l~ an let me to recall
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-109690-109872 um #krabi#
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-110068-110176 no friends
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-110260-110563 yah my o r d trip lah kind of
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-110661-110804 four day three nights
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-111016-111361 k~ #krabi# is a lot of s~ er sea activities
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-111371-111704 so we get to do er scuba diving
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-111709-112129 then snorkelling erm banana boats
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-112186-112333 and
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-112343-112451 what is that called ah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-112550-112786 er island hopping
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-112929-113038 it's package
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-113090-114361 yah actually they do al~ it's not very hard to plan to go #krabi# because once you reach there you go to the hotel area there are a lot of tour kind of small tour agencies there on the streets then they'll publicize to you yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-11422-11527 okay
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-114485-115080 yah it's very common so you have to find the cheapest package you ask around yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-115307-117016 erm not i mean it's become more of a rare touristy place lah like they have their food is not other than thai food there are a lot of western food to cater to the westerners lah so you see a lot a lot of tourists over there instead of locals then the locals i think the locals in that area is
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-11542-12075 erm actually i didn't come from a rich family i'm just come from anything i just maybe
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-117042-117834 er mainly they do business for tourists lah to survive not really like the locals local it's very
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-117876-118030 tourist orientated
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-118791-119065 mine is food and activities
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-119093-119541 so like the beach activity the sea activity is that attract the me most lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-119545-120519 so i thought it's quite fun and adventurous to try out all those because in singapore is very expensive to try snorkelling and stuff somemore their view is not very nice ah singapore nothing much to see
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-120533-121031 then for food wise yah of course you have to try the authentic thailand food #krabi#
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-12085-12745 l~ low middle income family lah so i don't my parents don't have much resources for me to engage tutors
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-121055-121722 so food and activist activities ah and most importantly is the company lah i think it's your friends that make it fun
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-12750-14854 so i thought that it will be good for peop~ students to have additional tuition ah because now people are getting more affluent and the income gap is widening so i don't think that is will be fair to have er it's like people is already in front of you for quite a few steps already so want to try to level the unfair advantage lah the playing field for the students
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-15072-15411 oh actually is i i started this lah with my friend
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-15425-17631 yah so we thought that since we have the resources because as because at that time i was in army then nothing much to do as usual so i'm quite bored so i thought that why don't i use this time and help people lah so the only skills i i was i came from a j c so the only skills i have is more of educ~ academic wise lah so my my my why not just make use of these skills to help people yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-18280-19066 um yah currently we do have around ten tutors with close to twenty students already so they do volunteer on a weekly basis lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-20251-21364 um actually is part of our youth club projects so our actually our um main objective of youth club is to really interact with youths or help the residents in our constituency
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-21371-23793 so in part of our community service project we try to outreach to youth by organising this blood donation drive although we target mainly on youth but uh not alot turn up lah but as usual alot of donors which are from other constituency they came down to donate do~ donated blood so because the blood donation drive the final objective is to really get blood for those like uh those blood type that is lower level lah yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-24346-24807 it's quite interesting because we just started this hungry-games last year
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-24811-26733 i think it's around may period so how these games come up we cow how we come up of this game is because we thought that want to find something to attract youth then we thought that other than gaming then we thought the food is a very good thing to attract youth so we thought of uh gathering all the best food stalls in yishun
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-26739-27126 and try to advertise the out as a programme so we do a trail
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-27137-29093 then we give participants a group of participants four to five then we give them some money then they go and visit all the stores and we h~ do have stations in between to let them really understand more about the food so example they can eat a plate of #char-kway-teow# but they do they know about the history of #char-kway-teow# er what ingredients the #char-kway# the stall owner use and stuff
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-29105-29862 so it's really more of to know more about food and to most importantly enjoy the food lah as a f~ with their friends or families lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-30224-31139 yah some some of course we will do more general one more general ingredients like the sauce the kind of going into details how they make the sauce we won't ah we'll skip that part is more of the general part
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-31864-32856 erm okay generally basketball is what i love lah then other sports i do erm not really ah i think i do a bit of running and stuff
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-33141-33736 erm not really i pay recreational basketball until uni so i join the hall team lah yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-33970-34227 um yah i'm still in the hall team
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-34403-34808 um in uni not really more of hall activities
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-34984-35308 so i joined uh productions for hall
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-35324-35869 so we acted out a play lah just ended i think is mid jan ah we perform on mid jan
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-35924-36314 the play was about the title of the play was forgotten
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-36342-36713 then uh it's about a it narrates about a family
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-36715-37124 so they have a the main character is the #ah-gong# whi~ has dementia
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-37140-38014 then when the family members do want the #ah-gong# stay with them so they keep pushing the #ah-gong# around so it's like a tragedy of the whole family
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-38019-38848 then in the end everyone in the end #ah-gong# is #ah-gong# is dead ah through a series of event then everyone start to feel that it's
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-38855-39060 start to reflect about their actions lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-39069-39613 so it's a more of in try to educate people about family values lah the play
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-39829-40261 erm i'm his i'm actually his son i'm called patrick
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-40269-42621 so i'm the sec~ i'm the oldest son but i'm not the oldest lah i've a older sister actually i'm okay to take my #pa# in just that my i have a wife which is very dominant then she don't like #ah-gong# at all and my daughter also so i've kind of a henpecked husband so i have to listen to them so i am more por~ portraying that i am i have i have no choice that kind of feeling
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-42632-43647 as the a son i try to be i try to be nice to my father but at the same time i have to face my wife and my daughter that kind of struggle ah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-43741-43907 hall eleven
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-44160-44282 i think
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-44300-44763 i heard only a few halls has productions because this is like an adhoc committee
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-44769-46709 so it like depends on the hall culture so sometimes some people have the bike rally that kind different kind of events ah so for our hall we have this productions t~ on ongoing so every year they will come together and say i want committee then during the december holidays we'll be very busy for us we'll be rehearsing and put our performance on january
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-47157-47538 er not really yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-47737-48186 er k~ ka~ not very forte just my interest lor my passion acting
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-48399-50053 yah i do actually last time i started acting in secondary school i do chinese drama last time now the forgotten is in english so er during this chinese drama journey i felt that it was quite fun and entertaining to do drama as an actor lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-50069-51372 so i made a lot of friends a lot of good memories and so we went for s y f competition we went for a public performance also so this kind of real let me realize that i really like drama and acting
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-51376-52030 but in j c i didn't get to get a chance to act because i didn't join the dra~ drama in j c
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-52155-52779 uh not really i just want to try different things yah but the passion came back during n s time lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-52785-53263 so after n s that period i went to help out in a polytechnic final year project
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-53266-53413 so we do filming
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-53417-53758 so i'm like um helping out as an actor also
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-53787-54198 then here and there i do calefare for some commercial shoots also
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-54383-54692 uh no lah mediacorp pay is very low
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-54697-55154 so it just those commercial like m o e yah they do have videos and stuff
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-55824-56416 yah i understand because for i think right erm i will say that uh
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-56417-56766 i won't say that my passion is that strong enough to make it as a career lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-56820-56991 so it's like more of a ho~
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-56999-57167 hobby kind of thing
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-57199-57480 so i don't think that i will treat it very seriously
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-57496-58326 yah so if i decide to treat it seriously likely i'll may come into n t u lah i'll be going to lasalle or anything lah some n a f a the
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-58328-58458 acting school
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-60023-60149 okay so
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-60191-61000 erm in chinese drama i feel that i am more comfortable in speaking mother tongue because my family speaks mother tongue since i was young lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-61007-61885 so i brought up in the mother tongue language so i feel that it's easier for me to relate my emotions using my mother tongue compared to english
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-61903-62044 and sometimes
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-62050-62229 english words are
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-62257-63096 i would say is too straight forward that we can't really play with the words for chinese one character have a lot of meanings so we do can play with their character and words
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-63129-65226 from my experience in chinese drama i feel that for secondary school is really my coach did is very dependent on a coach and a teacher instead of student initiative for uni hall eleven productions we do very depend dependent on the students although it's not very professional in a way but i think that that's how people grow lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-65234-65768 we really do things on our own booking a venue acting directing is there up is is their
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-65827-67355 their baby ah their idea then they try different things although it's not erm things somethings that we disagree we have disagreement over with lah but i believe that is a very good experience for us to take initiative and lead the whole project
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-67525-67674 yah student production
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-68228-71316 actually last time i was very unhealthy and fat in secondary school then my although i didn't qualify for the t a f-club my teacher my p e teacher recommend me to join the running club lah i think running club is full of athletes running long distance then it just to expanding so being the one of the erm least competent runner my teacher encouraged me to p~ proceed to carry on and run to start my running journey so i started from two point four click then four to five click and ten click lah then slowly i slimmed down and get better in running ah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-71347-71862 b then i start to join longer distance half marathon i think that's the furthest i run ah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-71979-72247 so we do that normally
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-72282-72700 like i don running at one or t~ around two twice per week lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-72712-72898 to try to keep myself fit
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-73315-73667 er i think is standard-chartered
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-73693-73856 standard-chartered-marathon
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-73866-74381 that that was the that was the one where i ran the twe~ tough marathon twenty one click
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-74929-75087 uh kind of lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-75249-75923 uh because i do have another medical condition i have asthma so i g~ not in a combat field unit
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-76250-76455 i was a air force technician
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-77107-77546 yah so they do send us to vocation school ah so it's at air force training school
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-77549-78679 then we learn for my role is i maintain radars lah so we do maintainence andinspection for radar like we weekly lah yah so they do have courses roughly i think it's one and a half month of courses
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-78941-79366 uh you can say so it's different ah different
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-80360-80463 okay
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-80569-81215 actually my vocation is quite slack ah so i d~ do have a lot of spare time
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-81234-81641 during my n s i do a lot of thinking and self reflection then
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-81652-82542 i thought and i try a lot of things during my free time my off days and stuff so i f~ one of the main thing i tried is to volunteer at my youth club
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-82560-82824 so i do a lot of projects over there
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-82837-83083 then another one is i try out acting
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-83111-84333 so my spare time like during although it's like kind of a moonlighting but during my spare time i go to try acting at uh shoots production and shoots lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-84604-85541 nope i stay out mine is on shift system so we don't we do have we do have stay in facilities also it's ours is not a camp is a facility lah yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-85556-85840 so we do m~ mending and rotation orh
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-86747-87091 i think the best part is made a lot of friends there
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-87104-87872 yah i i mean other than my n s f~ air friends we also made a lot of regular friends lah which ari e very close with them also even after i o r d
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-88002-88186 yah quite a few of them lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-88323-88504 um nope
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-88552-88759 but i s~ i think i
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-88816-89093 was closest with my regular friends
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-89117-89447 yah so they are still in army lah now in a unit
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-89806-90049 i think is to really the
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-90077-90289 just listen to instructions lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-90541-91370 yah it's like the chain of command it's the nature of um military style lifestyle lah it i will say that you need some time to adapt to it lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-91372-92036 because sometimes you have your own views you prefer things that way but its military yah you have to follow by the raw lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-93052-93298 um dialect hokkien
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-93428-93802 erm not really but i understand ah if people speak hokkien to me
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-93957-94193 erm my grandparents
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-94206-94738 um so sometimes my parents speak hokkien among themselves also so i listen
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-94815-95355 then my father do mix chinese and hokkien together lah when he speaks to me yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-96402-96539 oh
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-96597-96916 yah i think i i mean i will go a cantonese one
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-96919-97231 yah i want to try to learn a different dialect
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-97257-98079 because like i think with dialect if you know you're dialect well you can speak to more elderly i think it'll be great also yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-98358-98531 erm
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-98581-99396 for elderly we do have projects also we but it's more of a adhoc one we organise erm like a music
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-99404-99857 music festival for the elderly we visit their elderly home we perform for them
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session1-2-99876-101208 so we do tie up with a volunteering club called vol~ volunteer-guitar-connection they teach us guitar how to play guitar and we play those oldies for the elderly then we sing we play oldies we play games with them lah yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-00696-00806 yup
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-02247-03367 okay uh if you want to walk you have to walk through the long stretch along the south spine to north spine because now at the hive you have to proceed to the
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-03376-03709 food centre at is also name as #koufu#
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-03718-04903 then walk up the stairs and you will reach er i think it you will see an electronic a iants shop i t shop then you walk straight along the s~ the carp~ er the side of the car park
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-04907-05183 all the way straight then you will reach north spine
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-05205-05783 then north spine i think s a c is at level w~ level one yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-05797-06165 so at north spine you can go to the
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-06180-06289 where is the place called
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-06321-06550 erm let me think ah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-06697-06859 s a c
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-07068-07244 um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-07313-07434 okay
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-07564-08717 yah at level one you will see the when you walk all the st~ way straight to north spine you will see something like er prime-supermarket yah so from that area you walk
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-08731-08832 straight
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-08846-09026 you turn left
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-09040-09160 then
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-09205-10422 you go all the way to the staircase going down to a bus stop so but you don't go down the staircase at that s~ junction there you turn right into a small i think there is a small corridor
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-100387-101455 #jaga# okay #jaga# simply means that you have to handle a lot of things so like i'm #jaga#ing this and #jaga#ing that so i have a lot of on my plate so i'm trying handle things
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-101691-102724 okay so #cher# is just a short form of teacher so as singaporean students they like to like ask #cher# #cher# #cher# #cher# so it's more of er lingo lah yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-103302-105229 okay so actually we for this what is called blur right so when you call someone blur you will say that it's a muddlehead right so for blur we do have something add on as blur like #sotong# so it's like a catchphrase so people say you blur then people say you blur like #sotong# so it becomes a very frequently used phrase in our school
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-10448-10806 then you walk straight you should be you should be reach one s a c yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-105236-105823 so that's why it's quite singlish in a sense lah used by a stu~ commonly used by singaporeans
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-106153-107022 okay so #alamak# is like um in i will say that in your coun~ uh in western country they'll be like oh shit
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-107029-108291 yah so it's like oh my god you forgot something or you realize that something is not right so you'll suddenly eh oh a moment of epipahny like you suddenly think of something then you forgot to do and said oh shit so singaporean will say #alamak# something like that
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-108606-111021 okay so for confirm plus chop erm so the context is actually very funny so sometimes people say that um they ask you are you sure about this thing then people are confident so they will say confirm plus chop so that chop is more of like a stamp of warranty yah this is how they come so they'll it's just a lingo saying that yah i'm very sure that this can be done
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-111301-111581 so this is called #zhao#
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-111596-111825 #zhao# means is just let go
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-111832-112442 or you can or something that you can say in okay actually for #zhao# it's come from hokkien a dialect in singapore
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-112461-113483 so you can say that people #zhao# already people run away already or you can say more um less extreme version people say #zhao# means like let's go something like that yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-113846-115742 steady okay so for steady right erm in english terms is rather are you very firm or steady but in singapore context we use it as um are you bri~ um are you confirm are really are you willing to commit something like that so people say steady means that they're willing to commit to this thing
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-115998-118138 okay #suaku# means that is like erm relates to a chinese phrase so it's like people say that you are frog in a well ah so frog in the well means that you when you look up you only can see the circle of sky so you are not aware of surroundings means you are not well informed you are not well educated about things so you #suaku# means you're always in your own world and don't know a lot of things
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-11723-12210 okay for student-health-centre i think it's called the fullerton-health-service
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-12230-13147 okay from there oh okay there's a few ways to go there number one you have to walk back to all the way to the hive there
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-13156-13312 then you have to walk
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-13327-14128 okay the beside the hive there's this uh road you walk along into the road i no no walk along with the road
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-14130-14537 but don't walk outside the main road walk inside the buildings along the road
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-14547-15244 then walk all the way up there's a slight i think a slope so just walk all the way up and you will see the health-service-centre
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-15254-15684 so another way is to take uh i think is take campus-rider

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-15841-16065 so for campus-rider
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-16128-16787 um you should be going in between you should walk back the same road but the bus stop is at
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-16823-17008 #tan-chee-tuan# lecture
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-17012-17244 hall so i think that you walk
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-17276-17405 while you walking back
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-17416-18072 to south spine you will see a lecture theatre called #tan-chee-tuan# so there's a bus stop there you can take the green bus over there

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-49902-50354 okay so for the green line right you have to er from lavender
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-50361-50582 you take to
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-50702-51132 um you take one stop one station towards the tuas-link
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-51150-51267 to bugis

S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-54317-54429 purple line
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-54435-54552 north-east-line
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-54571-55045 so from there you can take to the direction of punggol-coast
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-55207-55548 so you just take along that stretch you'll reach punggol
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-57258-57803 okay so vivocity is at actually at harbourfront m r t station
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-57819-58185 so harbourfront m r t station there are a few ways to go
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-58214-59260 the first way is okay you re~ from n t u you always start from #boon-lay# mrt station so from #boon-lay# you can take towards tuas-link but you alight at outram-park
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-59445-59880 so at outram-park you have to change to the s~
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-59995-60502 north-east-line so from north-east-line you take towards the direction of harbour harbourfront
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-60512-60655 which only one stop lah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-60688-60858 or you can go to
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-61044-61489 buona-vista on the green line alight over there then you change to circle-line
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-61511-61888 so from circle line also the direction is towards harbourfront yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-62050-62191 um
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-62935-63169 ph yah okay so
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-63176-64104 actually for uh singapore food singapore is known for a food city there are a lot of local food where you can find in hawker centre and coffeeshop
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-64123-64716 so i were i think i personally will recommend erm chicken-rice and #laksa#
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-64728-65284 you know these two of my favourite and chicken-rice is internationally known as one of the singapore local food
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-65549-66777 okay so for chicken-rice right there are i think there are three main important things to a chicken-rice number one is definitely the chicken so we have quite a few variations one is white steamed chicken another one is roasted chicken
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-66793-67414 number third is soya sauce chicken and one more is um if is is less common which the fried chicken
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-67424-67813 yah so most of singaporeans eat roasted chicken and white steamed chicken
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-67816-68635 so it depends on your preference for white steamed chicken is very health healthier is healthier so because they simply boil it
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-68641-68923 and they'll i think they marinate it a bit
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-68930-70516 but for roasted chicken there are a lot put a lot of sauces and spices okay then the next thing of important to a chicken-rice is the rice ah it's not plain white rice they do a lot of i think they put some what's that called er is it er what is it called ah let me think ah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-70678-71163 i think it's some garlic lah yah when they steamed the rice so that add more flavour to the rice
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-71194-72273 and lastly is the chili so the chilli is one of the most important thing about the chicken-rice because it adds very spice flavor into the rice and the chicken
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-72292-73140 so if if you like you want to try something that is uh authentic and local i think that chicken-rice will be best for you
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-73147-73607 then if you want someone who can take spicy i would recommend the #laksa#
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-73613-74211 so laksa is just curry gravy with noodles and some prawns and fish cake
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-74252-74367 yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-74629-75187 erm for chicken-rice yes there are a lot of stalls selling chicken-rice i mean at our
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-75202-76355 hall our okay there's a canteen near our hall which called tamarind they sell chicken-rice and at south spine which the n b s school there's a #koufu# also sells chicken-rice there's a stall sells chicken-rice
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-76370-76565 for laksa i think
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-76604-77036 erm i cannot remember any store selling #laksa#s ah in n t u
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-77068-77194 <unk> um hm
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-77355-78000 um you can get #laksa# at jurong-point which at the #boon-lay# m r t station near there so there's a food cen~ court
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-78005-78172 yah at level four i think
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-78973-79377 okay so we have chinese malay and indian
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-79685-80245 for a chicken-rice uh it's called hainanese-chicken-rice it originates from hainan island
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-80250-80755 so it's definitely from chinese eth~ ethnicity #laksa# also
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-80790-81353 yah for if you want to try something from the malay ethnicity i think i will ne~ recommend #nasi-lemak#
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-81388-81700 yah so it's like erm
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-81704-82334 it's also rice but the rice is different kind of flavor so they do p~ use pandan leaf to steam the rice
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-82343-82834 and they do have the really nice delicious chicken wings and egg and chilli
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-82873-83437 then for indian ethnicity i think that um maybe you can try #roti-prata#
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-83445-83731 yah so it's more of a dough
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-83744-84060 they use dough and flour they kind of
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-84077-84284 erm you know pizza
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-84302-84652 yah so it's something similar to pizza the shape
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-84661-84835 but they dip it in curry
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-84862-85336 yah so it's and it's there's no other ingredients pinea e and ham it's just plain dough
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-85421-85666 and and they fry it on the frying pan
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-86114-87819 um for desserts singapore i think erm other than normal ice cream we do have something like er #ice-kacang# yah so it's mainly ice with covered with flavorful col~ different colorings of syrup
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-87831-88515 and red bean so because singapore you know is a tropical country it's very hot it;ll be very cooling to eat
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-88518-88833 k~ um ice dessert and stuff lah yah
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-89095-89409 er for singapore drinks
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-89421-90074 we do have er for a more local one i think you can drink try #milo# i iced-#milo#
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-90094-91148 iced-#teh# and or iced-#kopi# so what is iced-#teh# or iced-#kopi# okay #teh# is just actually tea in s~ english so they do have they put condensed milk in tea
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-91151-91291 and then put some ice
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-91297-91962 for #kopi# is what you known as coffee but it's different i think it's quite different the coffee in singapore
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-91964-92282 because they use different coffee the different powder
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-92583-92824 then for the #milo# i don't think you
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-92850-92986 which country you're from
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-93077-93337 cambodia i don't think cambodia sells #milo# right
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-93356-93748 yah so #milo# is actually an australian brand so it's something like cocoa
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-94138-94268 yup
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-95881-95991 okay
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-96177-97925 okay so this is botak is simply means bald means someone with no hair yah so in like a good example will be because every singaporean guy need to serve n s so we start of n s with a basic-military-training so everyone must shave it bald lah everyone must don't have cannot have hair
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-98328-99552 this is called #bojio# means that erm example you go out with your friends then another then you post on social media so another friend of yours saw it and they say eh why you #bojio# me say why you never ask me along
S1-mml-30-jan-2017-b-session3-2-99564-99981 so it's actually it's kind of a salty feeling ah yah
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-00537-01109 okay my name is muhammad-zahin-bin-mohd-ali and i'm majoring under biological sciences
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-01439-01796 ah yes because like i was from erm n
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-01798-03290 ngee ann poly and i was doing my diploma in molecular biotechnology so right after i graduated that was my next choice was to go under n t u's biological sciences actually i preferred i wanted to go under n u s but the cut off point was too high so that's that
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-03509-04003 uh for my g p a because i barely got into n t u's erm
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-04015-04310 degree course because i graduated with like a
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-04352-04788 like i think a few points more than the cut off point for n t u's
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-04796-04998 biological sciences so that that's why
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-05479-06169 okay when i was young like storytime from when i was young erm i wanted to be an archaeologist
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-06254-07238 then i realize that i couldn't be an archaeologist in archaeologist in singapore because singapore i mean what can i excavate anyway so and then i chose to
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-07247-07522 be a doctor but then i thought about it i'm like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-07541-07664 i'm not smart enough
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-07691-09109 so why and then i wanted to do to do erm medical examiner because i really felt er compelled to study the human body but at the same time to go for that you will require a bit it's a bit of a tough
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-09276-11064 what do you call that specialisation to do compared to something like biology in general because i can go in many different fields from graduating so that's why like when i was young i wanted to do lab work and from then on i got the chance to do it after i went into diploma
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-100627-102049 to me i'm i mean i was uh i managed to go into a specialist cadet school then i became a sergeant and i graduated then i was thrown to uh pulau-tekong as a sergeant over there and i had to deal with recruits
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-102410-102558 i would say it was
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-102609-103049 it helped in a way because erm i don't really l~ enjoy
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-103055-103385 scolding as much as unless i really have to
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-103389-103945 so i find it kind of ridiculous when people just burst into rage for something that so small
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-104101-104397 that's when i actually like was able to like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-104628-105244 i understand from their perspective what they're going through and s~ me being someone who has gone through what they've gone through
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-105259-106472 and it was ah i can use that experience to actually empathise with their situation and try to find solutions to what they're going through because in the end like when it comes down to people you you have to work with if
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-106480-107011 you do not address the the problems from the start it's going to turn out something ugly at the end
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-107077-108124 and that's what i feel about working with people erm even if we are of different ranks you s~ you cannot just expect people to just listen to you just because of that rank you know
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-108138-108414 it's it's kind of ridiculous and
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-108431-109161 some people do that and i don't agree with it but to each his own but for of the way that i work is
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-109181-109529 um by mutual agreement and there has to be some
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-109559-110108 form of mutual agreement to reach that common goal and that goal is actually to learn stuff to defend our country
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-110353-111180 it's not to do with power play it's nothing to do with erm politics i mean of course there's politics in work and whatever but
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-111192-112211 like if you base your leadership on just politics and power play it's it won't work but it's not going to work to your favor when the time comes for you to actually
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-11152-11553 and that is when i interned over at um i interned over at
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-112261-112579 like defend the country also but that you need to depend on
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-112603-113140 erm loyalty to your friends to each other and
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-113159-113502 caring and all that good vibes and stuff
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-114216-114356 okay
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-114536-114672 the specialist cadet school
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-115075-115391 erm okay um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-115695-115886 i mean physically it's a lot of running
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-11589-11893 a v a and that's when i realized that i
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-115918-116160 here and there um but
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-116183-117670 i guess the acumulati~ the accumulation of all the trainings right actually led to the when we had a one month ish uh training in thailand and that was crazy because the temperature there was about the highest temperature recorded was forty five
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-117758-118779 and the dryness level it is so dry okay the thing is that i'm okay when you sleep on the bed right there's fan but sometimes the fan doesn't work because the bunk is just
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-118824-119213 old okay and then um like when you wake up
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-119247-119419 your bed would be full of sweat
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-119533-120140 and like we were all guys ah so we just basically sleep like in just your und~ undies and stuff because it is really really hot
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-11965-12494 i i think i have to drive to to do lab work more than i have the drive to talk to people
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-120197-120994 and then in five minutes the stain the whole sweat stain will just dry up and then they will be like a patch there and they will just dry it's that disgusting
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-121074-121606 in about that time because at nine a m in the morning right it's already thirty seven thirty eight degrees celsius
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-121703-121920 yah it's it's mad then um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-121927-122622 so we had this um exercise i don't know whether i am i can say this though because its army
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-122650-122779 i'm not sure okay
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-122806-123371 okay but let's just give you the the small things that we did lah i mean we we walk around erm with
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-123485-123658 we did practice
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-123669-124161 of the whole exercise the walking around was like about three days and we covered about how many kilometres
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-124260-124718 uh how much ah everyday i covered about fifteen so i would say about fifty
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-124731-125416 there fifteen forty five to fifty i mean if you're lucky you cover forty five if you're unlucky you cover sixty ah because you go back and forth
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-12533-13053 so ah that's that in terms of my passion for biology
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-125474-125691 yah it was fun because um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-125733-125933 i slept under the stars
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-126054-126994 at night it was like because it was free and easy so we were just by ourselves navigating the whole area and if we got lost than we had we had to use um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-127046-127633 they will call this like a long range erm walkies but they're not really walkies there were like this whole big signals that we have to carry around
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-127656-128211 so yah it was fun um but this is a general idea of it lah because i don't know how much i can disclose
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-128215-128380 i'm not sure that's the thing
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-13497-13691 my favourite module erm
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-13958-14088 favourite module
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-14116-14277 god um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-14438-15001 actually now that i think about it um i would say my favorite module would be physiology
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-15021-15779 cause i i took it in um when i was in poly and also when i'm do my degree now and
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-15806-16331 it's interesting because you can actually link link up the things that you've learned from
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-16355-16961 uh physiology all the way up to your current activities and what you do
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-16966-17365 so when i read um sometimes when i read um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-17427-18131 doctors uh prescriptions or testimonials regarding my par~ parents or my grandparents it's easier for me to understand the
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-18143-18513 erm the words that come come uh that were written
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-18525-19237 but in general like even if i don't understand if i google it i can get the layman's terms to understand what is being written so i get a better idea
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-19276-20056 so yah that's i guess that's my favorite right now but in terms of like electives i'm taking philosophy and it's quite interesting
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-20262-20462 i'm taking philosophy of friendship
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-20473-20687 to be a better friend
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-21097-21345 it's really f~ it's easy to understand
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-21354-21927 because it's relatable to what you do and even if i mean it connects back to moral ethics and
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-21931-22232 although moral ethics is a bit confusing ah cause i never really took it
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-22330-22507 the fact that it connects to
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-22532-23718 things that you can actually understand and um used in real life contexts it's interesting and yah it's it's not difficult in the sense of modern philosophy i tried to go for one class and i just
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-23774-24268 zoned out because she was talking about um personal identity i didnt identity and i didn't get it
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-24293-24884 yah but in terms of friendship it's it's quite simple erm the differences between love and friends and like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-24938-25676 the fungibility problem and stuff like that erm so it's relatively quite simple and the fact that it engages
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-25679-25904 a different like part of
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-25968-27508 my study to what about what am i saying like a different part of my brain somewhat to actually like think about this scenarios and come up with plausible answers for it it's interesting as compared to it's more interesting as compared to biological cause biology is quite straightforward
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-27520-28370 erm the answers are either there or not there and if it's not there just to find the answers there's but in philosophy there's no straight answer to it there's always arguments there's always perceptions
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-28494-28967 it's it's more engaging to the brain rather then just straightforward answers
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-29712-29814 concepts
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-29844-29955 erm
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-30077-30314 ah concepts oh god um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-30727-30961 um wait let me think about it first um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-31485-31672 well like i feel
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-31700-32004 okay there's this concept on every aristotle that talks about
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-32006-32110 um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-32149-32764 only the good people can can actually achieve the perfect friendship but in general like i feel that
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-32796-32969 like erm
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-32979-33514 people who have inadequacy like unequal um basis of virtues they
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-33526-33993 can get the same amount of friendship if the virtues actually overlap with each other
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-34015-34432 and like they complement and the way they complement actually um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-34486-34904 it brings both of them into higher level of thing uh of character
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-34968-35136 so that's why i feel that
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-35304-36213 the basis of friendship shouldn't just be because that oh you're good and i'm good so therefore we should be friends doesn't mean like that it should be complementary to each other and if
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-36224-36748 two people are all good then it doesnt makes sense for them to actually be friends because
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-36793-37103 they wouldn't actually bring added value into the friendship
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-37190-38189 so that's my opinion about that and i there's other things about philosophy but i'm i'm not good at it i'm just like learning stuff because i enjoy it not because
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-38201-38532 i i'm very good at it or anything but like yah
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-38948-39737 oh right now i mean uh harmonics i'm doing acapella with the school uh with n t u harmonics so yah
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-40200-41386 acapella is to me is one of the toughest form of singing because uh i've done singing when i was younger um from when i was in secondary school primary school siti-nur-haliza we all started somewhere
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-41419-42170 ziana-zain oh my gosh but like um those where the divas of that era and still a diva i'm not saying anything about that
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-42206-44113 i can't match up to them so i i'm i kind of like learn my own style of singing and like i enjoyed the art of it because it's it's one of the things that actually got me through poly itself because i was in a song composing club and we ventured under different genres and experimented with music original music from different genres
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-44125-44338 so like erm
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-44391-44973 that's where i first started performing and stuff but like solo singing and acapella singing is two different things
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-45039-45178 acapella is
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-45233-45990 tough because like strings of an instrument if you s~ play the wrong note it just turns into a different chord and then everything gets thrown off
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-46036-46241 and that that's my problem
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-46262-47018 actually being rooted to a note uh and actually being able to sway with the note without uh going a bit too sharp of or too flat
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-47023-47772 but in general it's been a it's been a very enjoyable experience with everyone because we come from different backgrounds of music and different styles
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-47790-48349 so everyone has their own stylistic stylistic interpretation of music and how it's su sed to be presented
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-48372-48562 and the way
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-48621-49089 this mix happens it's enriching to myself because i get to enjoy
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-49102-49209 different
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-49244-49707 music forms and different people from different walks of life and it's
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-49727-49855 it's something that
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-49870-50015 um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-50049-50514 has been fun and i do enjoy it and i do wish to see more of it
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-50587-51123 although i feel that like uh we shouldn't restrict ourselves to just pop music
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-51839-51984 hm sure
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-52826-53107 i wou~ i i would say it's like a special kind of thing
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-53479-53579 really
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-53666-54085 oh ya ya we are though uh in concl~ like er we just
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-54117-55148 okay i was from er c a c orientation club and like i joined c a c special club for a special events and from then on then i realize that oh harmonics wasn't
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-55217-55457 erm a c a c club yet
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-55476-56369 but us as of last semester when c a c didn't happen in n t u we were officiated into the club uh and that was
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-56416-56963 it was nice to get recognition for the work that the seniors did and i would think that
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-56999-57480 their efforts really transpired into something that was really concrete in terms of
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-57523-58316 getting that recognition that we need in or~ to get funds to to actually do up programs and make sure that everything runs smooth
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-58326-58783 because it's hard being a solo c c a without any backing from any monetary funds
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-59395-59797 i i um it's it it it is um hm yah
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-59995-60763 ah for me music is my passion um but i'd enjoy reading sometimes
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-60851-61522 but i haven't read enough the past year because um well i just urm
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-61542-61821 o r d'd last year and then
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-61846-62971 er n s took a lot of my time and then uni is taking most of my time so i'm waiting for summer break to happen so i could just like read more and be more literate
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-63066-64288 in a way it's kind of like yah sure literate and shit but erm it is it's important to read lah i mean i gain more perspect~ much more pers~ pers~ perspective than just being stuck on an island with people i don't really know
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-65103-65252 i don't watch drama
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-65261-66050 because i'm too lazy to catch up with the whole thing i mean the only dramas the only like like so called uh comedy is it called chick flicks
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-66097-66729 um i don't know what they called erm i used to watch two broke girls because i'm broke too
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-66732-67061 um what else do i watch um um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-67066-67284 friends obviously who haven't watch friends
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-67296-67609 ah oh wow um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-67616-68280 how-i-met-your-mother that too um other than that like not really much i mean i i do
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-68282-68574 watch anime here and there i mean just
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-68582-68848 just for the fun of it because i like cartoons
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-68865-69052 more than real life dramas
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-69112-69481 which is kind of weird because i'm old enough to like real life dramas but i don't
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-70200-70314 yah i was
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-70831-71290 okay in secondary school i was in erm scouts
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-71522-71627 yeah there is
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-71722-72214 primary school days but i wasn't in scout primary school i was from in life science club
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-72343-73436 yeah in my i was from chua-chu-kang primary school and we had like life sciences club so i did hydroponics i did uh gardening i did i did um all extractions random stuff like that
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-73503-73612 yah but
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-73772-74063 probably in a in a weird way
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-74118-74314 i guess um but like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-74320-75845 yah in terms of secondary school it was scouts and it w~ um it was fun lah although people would say that it's like oh scouts all uniform groups and stuff like that but i think i learned a lot about myself from that yah because erm i was given the o rtunity to
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-75879-77090 be able to hold a leadership position in that um that club itself and the exposure itself brought me to different people of like like from different schools and then we actually were able to
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-77333-77894 converse and share experiences between each other and that's the important thing and the the
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-77913-78098 the way scouts work is that it's
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-78109-78550 like a union between kids who have a major passion for
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-78553-79027 the outdoors and survival skills and stuff like that so it was
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-79061-79438 fun and i i managed to go for a jamboree which is a
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-79442-79572 which is like erm
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-79724-80256 so it's like i think in my sec four years or when i graduated it's like uh jamboree it's like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-80270-80817 erm gathering of different scouts from the whole like from the whole world
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-80834-81404 so like the like every continent or every like so called not continent i mean every country
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-81416-81660 er who has scouts in their
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-81714-84574 country as they have like they actually sent over um scouts like a few handful of them to singapore when at that point in time was in singapore it was like in twenty ten i can't i can't remember um and then like we just share experiences we we build stuff we talk we have conferences and then we just talk about uh all of experiences we share and like i managed to talk there was a bit of language barriers ah between us like i tried talking to cambodians but it was kind of tough
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-84670-85541 erm it was just like the the struct~ their english was okay just that the structure of their their sentences is a bit awkward i guess it's cause of the the native languages itself
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-85581-85920 and thais and i talk to
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-85937-86095 there were a lot malaysians
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-86126-86418 erm but in terms of
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-86552-87194 oh yah i remember the reason why the reason why there was no white people it's because it's an asian thing like asean
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-87221-87944 so there was a lot of erm japanese there were er they were erm chi~ china doesn't have any scouts
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-87988-88363 erm okay koreans i think i'm not sure i can't remember
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-88983-89790 wow okay um yah it's a it's a s~ it's a generalisation i mean um ok
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-89806-89922 yah i do
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-89963-90205 you look like someone who will who'll be from girl guides though
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-90234-90343 n p c c
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-90434-90578 oh
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-90600-91995 okay but okay um life skills i would say like um given i mean in any k~ form of leadership uh role you would have the opp~ you would need to lead bunch of people
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-92001-93239 to a common goal and from then on you learn how to manage your time between studies and the c c a itself and like you learn how to talk to people of different backgrounds and in order to actually like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-93302-93991 connect to people who do not have the same background as you you have to really try to empathize and with their
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-94137-94438 them and what they've gone through and understand
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-94440-94618 from their point of view
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-94660-94906 how they perceive things to be
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-94946-95730 and that's important an important life skill because it makes sure that you're able to work with different people and not just with people you like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-95816-96127 yeah it's a b~ it's a bit of like you have to learn how to give and take
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-96170-96559 cause there will be people who want to like um piss you off
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-96793-97111 because i mean just because they want to piss you off
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-97348-97856 you have like everyone everyone wants good for themselves and if you can motivate them to actually find that
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-97860-98028 good in whatever they are doing
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-98060-98983 then it will be easy for you to actually coordinate with people and the hard part is actually trying to find that common goal for everyone to reach
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session1-2-99030-99513 and yah that's one thing that i would say i kind of learnt but have not perfected it
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-00313-00528 hello oh yes i am singaporean
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-01249-02865 from lakeside to outram-park okay so right we are at now if you make a straight if you walk straight up and turn at about turn to the left at about three hundred metres you will see a sign that says um m r t just follow the m r t sign you will and you will probably reach to lakeside m r t
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-02880-03439 and from then on right just take um the train from lakeside from the green line
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-03442-03952 that says that is going all the way to pasir-ris take the train towards pasir-ris
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-03961-05105 and from then on you would reach probably in about erm one two three four five six seven eight nine ten in about approximately ten stops
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-05121-05478 and at when you exit the train there you are at outram-park
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-06559-07062 i would suggest that you take a bus because you'll be going through from
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-07069-07222 it will be a bit
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-07338-07808 saying that you'll be going through from erm south to north part
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-07827-09616 of singapore i mean i'm not really sure about the buses that you that you can take but i could probably google maps for you but if you want to take an m r t it's i mean it's possible but i wouldn't advise it although um erm probably you could just take the train towards jurong-east and transit from the green line over to the red line and from red line you can just
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-09618-09844 take erm at about
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-09854-10347 one two three four five six seven stops and you will reach woodlands m r t
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-100225-100663 the urgency to do something in a faster motion or to get people to actually move
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-100687-101790 faster for you so let's say if i were to say er come on guys let's do this work chop chop then we can go home basically means that i'm asking them to do the work in a like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-101824-102199 more it it's there's this like urgency to do that work
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-102211-102456 so that we can all go back home
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-103022-104058 yap in a way you could you could use it in a way that's like uh uh a fast motion to ask someone to actually do the things in a more urgent manner because you have to go somewhere or something like that
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-104574-104767 oh it's pronounced as #atas#
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-104908-105298 #atas# so okay let's say erm
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-105423-105584 let's say
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-105617-106033 erm i buy a branded good that is not
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-106055-106305 that is not like its a count~ it's a counterfeit
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-106331-106692 and then like my friend will tell me that i just want to
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-106715-107011 be #atas# in a way like like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-107015-107369 erm there's another like singlish word to it which is like step #atas#
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-107376-108006 step is basically steps but in our singlish con~ er context it's more of like trying to be
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-108019-109164 and then #atas# itself basically means like you're like above everyone else so you're trying to be above of some ev~ ev~ everyone else and in that case it's like saying that you are above everyone else because you buy branded goods but it's
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-109188-109440 but it's not proper because its counterfeit
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-109449-109831 so that's why it's like trying to step #atas# in a way
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-110179-110471 it would you could des~ describe someone who's the rich as #atas#
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-110652-111067 it basically means that you are like of higher standing of higher standing than others
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-111076-111468 so it goes to mean like let's say your grades is very good then you basically #atas# ah
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-111734-111895 above average i would say
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-112815-112956 erm
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-113166-114263 the thing about singlish singlish language is that it's very um we cut out words that are not needed inside the context of the whole sentence so we get to the point as soon as uh as much as we can like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-114280-114675 just straight to the point so when you say act cute right it's like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-11477-11782 well i would suggest that you could go to
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-114807-116542 it's like a short form for someone who is acting cute but you just want to like say out straight get to the point so act cute so you just cut up all the unnecessary words which is acting you cut it out to act so in its little context it just means someone who is trying to
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-116554-117008 be adorable trying to be cutesy in that kind of sense
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-117222-117696 erm i mean i don't see it in a negative con~ connotation to it because if
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-117717-118166 i'm so called acting cute that means there's some form of me that's still cute
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-11785-12553 i mean there's a lot of nature reserves not a lot but is considerably enough nature reserves in singapore i wouldn't recommend going to the zoo because
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-118345-119525 and i dont see it in a bad light but some singaporeans use it in a degrade degradatory term degradatory term so i um i don't really see it in a bad light but like i'll take it as it is
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-119900-120293 you cute but the thing is that the cat is already cute so doesn't really make sense
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-120972-121086 #machiam#
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-121108-121817 ok um #machiam# itself derives from the word #macam# in malay which basically means like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-121846-122969 so in general like this kind of words in singlish is brought upon by uh brought from different languages singlish itself is a combination of different languages from cantonese hokkien malay
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-122980-123597 a bit of tamil i would say but i'm not really sure where it comes from and also it's a very um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-123683-124515 it's a vocalise kind of language when it comes to singlish so the way i see it like i could say as #machiam# or i could say as like er
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-124644-125073 erm the context of the whole sentence of it changes the the meaning of the word
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-125125-125634 but #machiam# in general is erm likening it to something else
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-12564-12993 like why go to the zoo when you can experiences experience nature by itself
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-125660-126342 so let's say like he eats like a pig so i would say er he eats #machiam#
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-126359-126996 pig i mean although it doesn't really make sense in that case but if someone was to use #machiam# it would be something like likening it to something else
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-127652-127883 oh no no no no but uh
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-127923-128655 likening it to something else it's like yah it's like litera~ litera~ literature literature ah like like yah you get what i mean
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-129004-129408 yah you could you could do that i mean it's a bit broken singlish but you could
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-13003-13536 but if you do want to go to the zoo there's a bus from choa-chu-kang m r t that goes straight there
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-13576-13881 uh i have no idea how else to go to the zoo because
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-13886-14878 erm of the fact that i don't really go there that much but there is a bus from choa-chu-kang er er i can recheck from google maps where the bus is where you can take a bus from
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-15608-16041 well not really i mean zoos are more like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-16052-16347 of a tourist attraction but i would say the nature reserves is just
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-16354-16839 i mean i've seen a lot of people running around there you could probably go for runs around there if you're interested in that
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-16878-17720 but erm it's much more toned down because it is not a lot of people over there and you could basically just walk around and experience
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-17792-18233 singapore's tropical areas i would say of
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-18259-18608 but i mean there's a lot of things to see over there i mean i i s~
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-18667-19008 there's there could be crocodiles on there if you're not careful
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-20215-21072 erm you consider paying for transport to go over then yah you have to pay for transport but it probably cost you less than two dollars to go over there from outram if you're from there
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-21140-22165 but entrance over there is free for everyone you got macritchie reservoir you got sungei-buloh reservoir you got kranji area i'm not really sure where kranji is at but
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-22174-22606 when where is it at but i know there's the sungei-buloh one which is in the north
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-22642-22867 north west side of singapore
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-23921-24235 erm well you could go to sentosa
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-24270-24557 i forgot what is it called cause i have never been there before
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-24613-24908 i mean after they revamped the whole area it used to be called
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-24928-25132 ah i can't remember what is it called
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-25145-25900 but the last time i went to that area was when i was like really young but you could check it out probably there is a website on sentosa's um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-26037-26352 directory regarding tourism board from the tourism board
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-26500-26649 from pictures
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-26664-27179 that i have seen from my friend's instagram and social media i would say it's pretty a nice place
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-27223-27602 price wise i'm not sure but so yes you have to check it out from the website
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-28210-28439 oh it's simple uh basically you just take
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-28454-28613 erm
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-28616-29580 train to harbourfront or you could take a bus to harbourfront and if you go inside the mall at vivocity you go all the way up you can either choose to actually cross by foot
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-29614-29902 erm because sentosa itself is an island of
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-29942-30191 the south coast of singapore
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-30214-30788 so you could probably go there via uh train which is like a i wouldn't say train its a monorail
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-30833-31212 erm and or you could choose to walk i mean it's up to you
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-31261-32202 but i would say you should take the train the monorail because it's er faster and one thing in singapore is really hot climate warm and humid so
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-32261-32727 if you have a choice and you've the money to take a tram why why not take the tram
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-33459-33559 in my house
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-33764-34246 okay generally like not okay i am kidding overhearing that but erm
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-34359-34502 i usually hang out
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-34549-34748 around areas where i can get food
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-34832-35357 erm and that depends on where i want to go so usually like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-35384-35632 as as a young person
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-35641-35961 the first place you would ever go if you if you're ever bored is
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-36071-36191 central area
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-36206-37136 erm but for myself sometimes i'm too lazy to go over there so i just go to jurong area jurong-east area has a lot of uh malls and wholesale malls with
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-37148-37353 different erm
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-37361-37535 different brands that you could
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-37542-37779 patronise in so it's really quite nice
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-38159-38415 oh town area is in i mean
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-38545-39012 erm central of it all is orchard but actually extends all the way until
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-39219-39352 all the way until
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-39529-41004 i would say bugis area and raffles-place area so about the stations for raffles-place raffles-place city-hall erm orchard somerset and bugis dhoby-ghaut also i would consider it as town area
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-41045-41548 but erm they are a bit far apart so i wouldnt recommend that you walk
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-41571-41847 unless it's at night time cause then it's kinda cold
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-42026-42153 yup that is smart
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-43613-44129 erm okay the merlion is basically erm from the story of s~
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-44426-45349 it's a myth it's a form of legend it's not a myth it's a legend because myth is based on something but it is a legend erm of a
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-45360-45911 combination of two creatures which is the fish and the the mermaid and uh and a lion
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-45942-46506 if so the creature is actually a head of a lion and the body of a fish in the form of a mermaid
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-46510-46719 so that's why they call it a merlion
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-47145-47684 i i mean if you want to take if want to paint it like one of your french girls could be it could be horizontal
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-48203-48625 okay it's in singapore-river and it basically looks like um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-48633-48855 a white marble statue
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-48891-49989 no i don't know whether it's marble or not but it's a white in color um yah it's not marble it's white in colour and erm it basically spits out water in a continuous fountain kind of way
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-50002-50412 erm the mane is dripping all the way until the n~
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-50436-51444 erm i would say until the shoulder level of the mermaid the rest of the body itself is a body from mermaid with scales which is the tail area
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-52128-52299 yah yah google will help a lot
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-53104-53535 okay depends on whether you want to take a scenic route or you just want to walk over there
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-53541-53938 i mean if you want to take the scenic road or just want to take the m r t over there straight
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-54067-54488 the scenic road would be walking from clarke-quay all the way down to raffles-place
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-54808-55542 it's just the singapore river the skyline itself at at night it will look nice plus the nightlife over at clarke-quay is a thing so you could probably go visit
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-55553-55859 around the whole area they have bars and like tapas
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-55862-56157 bars over there where you can get food if you wish to
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-56180-56553 but if you don't you could probably just take
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-56563-56791 erm a train
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-56863-57324 to raffles-place and just take a walk s~ over there i mean you have to walk either way
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-57335-57741 but the scenic route will be from clarke-quay although it will take some time for you to walk there
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-59366-59665 what i eat for breakfast would be just bread
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-59724-60001 and sometimes half boiled eggs depends on my mood
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-60034-60395 but what singaporeans considered as like uh
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-60417-60682 like a so called traditional way
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-60697-60914 erm breakfast would be just
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-60935-61645 erm kaya toast with butter on one side and #kaya# on one side and #kaya# is actually just like coconut ish jam
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-61792-62372 yah but it's just a coconut jam erm er sometimes its flavoured with pandan or or they have this
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-62389-62959 erm it's it's basically just egg and coconut ish kind of taste to it i don't really know how to place it but it's
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-62961-63128 it's more on the
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-63202-63302 sweet
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-63320-63463 side of the palate
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-63510-63703 yah but it it taste like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-63904-64029 smooth jam
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-64039-64930 but less of the berry kind of taste to it okay it's more of like i mean it's a coconut so yeah but uh in general that is
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-64969-65396 a common singaporean erm erm breakfast toast
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-65400-65561 butter #kaya#
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-65609-65986 uh not butter as more of margarine #kaya# and
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-65992-66182 erm two
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-66392-66617 two eggs half boiled
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-66683-66989 and then they will just crack it and mix it with soya sauce
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-67012-67119 and
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-67121-67336 erm black pepper
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-67470-67630 then they give you an entire egg
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-67676-67819 oh yes yes you have to
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-67897-68059 erm er
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-68093-68666 they do cook it for you and then they give you the the whole eggs after that but you have to break it and put inside erm
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-68688-68834 then crack inside a
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-68848-69237 a small plate for yourself and then usually for me i will take
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-69256-69390 um coffee
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-69427-69717 from the from the stall from the
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-69743-70088 food court itself because the coffee there is
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-70114-70884 they say in the form like erm it's more concentrated than coffee outside so it's a bit sweeter so if you don't really like sweet coffee then it's
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-70902-71366 i would say you should ask for less sugar or less milk less condensed milk so yah
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-71915-72563 yes erm i would say the the whole meal itself is about erm two fifty to three dollars depending on where you are at
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-72635-73294 although if you were to get it at this area called er #kopitiam# it will probably cost you about two fifty two seventy
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-73305-73751 depending on where you're at because if you're nearer to the city area then
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-73764-73903 uh it's a bit pricey
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-75397-75914 okay myself it's uh uh my for myself i
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-75998-76947 i am a mixed race person so i am a mix of malay and indian so i'm not really culturally indian but i have a palate for indian foods
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-76973-77551 so in general i would say for breakfast if you are um if you want to taste
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-77567-77779 um what malay
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-77793-78110 people actually eat for breakfast would be something like #lontong#
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-78183-78347 and #lontong# is basically like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-78369-78848 er #lontong# is basically er rice cakes with um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-78930-79043 a sort of
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-79089-79335 mix erm a sort of
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-79357-79671 i wouldn't say it's a curry but it's like a soup base with
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-79680-80004 erm i'm not sure what the soup base is made up of
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-80085-80359 but i know it's really tasty
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-80536-80709 um
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-81455-81896 an indian version of breakfast would be #thosai#
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-81984-82961 #thosai# is like it's like erm you basically have a like a paste that you that you mix it's like a waffle paste but not really a waffle paste
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-82964-84121 i don't really know how to describe it cause i've never really made it myself but you basically make it into a huge pancake and then you cook it until it's crispy and then you fold it into a large cylindrical shape and you serve it with
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-84131-84321 um three types of
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-84336-84589 cur~ no i wont say curry but three types of
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-84654-85137 curry paste in some way there's one that's normal curry there's one erm white coloured
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-85168-85660 pasty kinda curry that is more towards erm coconut flavored
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-85666-85775 in a way
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-85782-86249 and then there's the red version which is er mixed with er blended chillies and
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-86254-86494 erm spices from the indian family
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-87602-87928 it's not really about the chicken but it's more about how the rice is cooked
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-87945-88573 it's erm mostly cooked with i'm not really sure the act~ the proper ingredients but i know there's a ginger
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-88618-88849 because i found ginger in my rice before
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-88852-88973 erm
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-89043-89171 i think this
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-89287-89908 erm flavoured water that they use but i'm not really sure what kind of water is it is it i'm not sure
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-89913-90326 erm but from the the way i smell it like there's a lot of ginger in it
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-90511-90644 from the smell
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-90716-91297 no i w~ i actually bit into it so that was a problem but like erm
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-91323-92547 yah and like the way the way the chicken is cook it depends on the the the the chicken rice that you ordered it could be hainanese it could be different forms as malay form of chicken rice but the basis of the rice itself is the same for all
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-92554-92712 all are different
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-92761-93055 um cuisines of different races in a way
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-93082-93714 but in general like erm if you look at the chinese version of chicken rice itself it's
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-93728-94332 er it's mostly steamed or roasted chicken and then there's they also have like different incorporations with
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-94349-94462 erm
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-94726-95003 but that will be duck rice already so it's not chicken anymore
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-95081-95497 but uh as in terms of the roasted chicken
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-95775-96367 so like that's why i feel about chicken rice itself like there's a lot of different variations of it but the basis as the rice itself
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-96775-96896 oh we love it
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-96910-97494 but we don't we don't like eat it every meal like if you were to eat chocolate every meal like it will probably feel like
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-97575-97701 er yah
S1-mml-4-apr-2018-b-session3-2-99498-100004 okay chop chop is basically like what we singaporeans termed as like erm
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-00351-00744 hey hi i'm justine and i'm majoring in english literature
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-01047-01224 er yes it was
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-01282-01384 yeah it was
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-01484-02309 er because i really like literature and there's not much else i'm very good at so
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-02508-02728 yes i did all the way yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-02853-02996 er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-03020-03732 i think it was compulsory in secondary school then after that er it was interesting ah it was more interesting than any other subject so yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-03735-03840 i guess so
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-04079-04236 er year four
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-05262-05962 er yes in my first and second year i joined the school muay-thai and brazilian-jiu-jitsu club
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-05986-06404 then uh in my second year also i joined er acapella group
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-06431-06819 yah and currently i'm only still in that acapella group
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-07195-07931 it's actually those unproper c c as they're interest groups ah but er we meet once or twice a week and then we
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-07950-08461 uh and like s~ for those interested in fighting but
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-08464-08722 muay-thai is a lot of er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-08729-09519 kicking and punching whereas b j j is a lot of floor work so you're hugging a lot of people on the ground rolling around yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-09692-10166 no not good but because the guy i liked was there so i went there
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-100372-101736 oh erm oh they have this thing called er i think the correct term is midies yah where they separate the different parts remember i was talking about the soprano alto all that yah so they er have er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-101912-102467 like a i won't say video audio recording of each individual but which you can listen to
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-10196-10459 yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-102479-103254 yah and i'm more of a audio learner than a visual in this case cause i can't read notes so yah that helps a lot
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-103535-103679 correct yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-103831-103958 oh definitely
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-103977-104944 er i have to combine with the other people and sing together but i think singing together also is very important yah so
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-105040-105679 practice is very important yes both with yourself and with the entire group yes yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-106375-106488 yes that's right
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-107066-107381 er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-107598-107854 personally for me er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-10769-10971 uh i think it's
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-107922-109123 well i mean for one thing it's finding the right people to sing with people you want to sing with but after that also i think it's translating er your normal singing into performance singing
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-109132-109921 yah because uh singing to each other is very different from performing to a crowd of people yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-109934-110513 and that can goes back to that thing i was saying about stepping out of my comfort zone because
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-11000-11313 quite hard unless somebody uh like
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-110517-110903 like for example when i perform i like to look at the floor i dont like to look at people
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-110909-112708 cause it's easier to concentrate on my note when i'm looking at the floor but yah so you've like maintaining eye contact making sure you look like you're enjoying yourself or appropriate to whatever the mood of the song is and if choreo is necessary remembering your choreo but still singing properly
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-112718-112833 so yah the the
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-112848-113286 entire performance aspect of acapella is something that is
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-113296-113596 difficult for me yah but
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-113847-113985 yah er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-11403-11834 it's not really self defence but it's a good form of exercise
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-114035-114733 but i mean that's the whole point right to get better so hopefully yah especially the dancing part
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-114761-115010 thank you
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-115486-115978 er yah currently i'm the welfare officer for the club yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-116106-116756 er su sely lah yes yes yes i try i try i try yes as a as the
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-116879-117024 er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-117604-117770 its very hard to
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-117791-120097 uh individually help everybody because er of the way the club is and i think it would be difficult or for them to want to approach me specifically as well because i'm sure they have their own problems but er as much as i can like for example we ce~ help celebrate their birthdays we organize bonding events for them and uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-11848-12311 but maybe cause i suck at it if you're good at it maybe you can use it in real life yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-120127-120615 yah but currently due to a lack of a concrete
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-120632-121134 er of permanent club room i think like a lot of er what i could do it
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-121145-121286 er cannot be done
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-121296-122208 yah because we move eh we have a room in the hive but uh i mean it's a common classroom so we can't leave any of our stuff there
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-122555-122674 you're welcome
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-13137-13441 no i would run
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-13680-14301 if i can help can help orh but if not i would it will make more sense to leave and get help from elsewhere yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-15076-15272 yes i stayed during my first year
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-15463-16059 er as in the hall life wasn't for me
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-16081-17169 uh it was very tiring and everybody wanted was always doing something you had to be doing something or like in a lot of committees in order to ensure hall stay for the following year
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-17178-17787 and it just felt like a lot of effort for me and i couldn't have time to study or have time to myself yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-18060-18160 yah it was
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-18179-18302 yah correct
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-18654-19285 so like they have a lot of sub committees and committees uh for different events so uh i had to join
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-19317-20878 a b~ hall block commitee the sub comm and then i had to join like their newspaper slash magazine sub comm also and a whole bunch of different sports slash er what they call them games there's what i think there was er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-20933-21349 what do you call that thing there were darts there was scrabble there was boggle
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-21352-21732 got there was netball there was volleyball
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-21745-22517 it's a lot and correct and yah i didn't have time at all to do my own work yah so it was very tiring
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-22644-22830 yah it was at night
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-23043-23273 oh my god yah every night
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-23284-23723 every night i'll be awake until maybe two or three easily
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-23729-23839 yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-24459-25590 i still sleep at two or three sometimes but er at least i have more time to myself and more time to do the things that i really want to do not just things i'm forced to do yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-25777-25964 like er acapella singing
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-25974-27060 okay so er the acapella group is called harmonics er it's very new it's about one or two years old uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-27089-27451 er what what about it would you like to know about
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-27538-29122 i mean we sing ah er we we have different we have like sub groups each group has about maybe six to eight people then er we have our own repertoire each group and then we go out and do gigs
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-29129-29239 yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-29720-29849 normal singing
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-29852-31533 er over one thing acapella means er without i believe it means without instrument or purely vocals so yah that's one thing then another thing is uh because i was from choir in secondary school and j c is er and that has safety in numbers whereas acapella is one person per part
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-31539-31741 so that er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-31747-32322 really causes you to have to believe in yourself and in your teammates yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-32358-32458 its a bit different
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-33124-33473 to be honest i really hate performing i'm very shy
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-33477-33902 uh up to now i still don't really like it ah but uh it's
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-33929-34409 fun and enjoyable to perform with my teammates so
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-34413-35425 that encourages me to step out of my comfort zone so every time we perform i'm stepping out of my comfort zone but yah but it's okay because i'm not alone they are there
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-35438-35580 yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-36174-36307 correct yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-37040-37855 er i was a soprano in choir then when i came to acapella i they make me alto but then now they make me sop again so
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-37869-38022 i su se yes same part
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-38286-39774 soprano oh sopranos they have like different sections this is from highest to lowest uh soprano alto tenor bass and then in between they have like mezzo sop which is like in between soprano and alto and baritone which i believe is in between tenor and bass
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-39785-40169 yah so it's just different sections for your vocal range yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-40344-40585 you
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-40620-41424 play a keyboard and if you can hit the note i su se that is your range i'm not a musical person
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-41623-42513 i think it's highly recommended that you have musical background but yah it definitely helps ah like reading notes and stuff but no i don't have musical background yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-43156-43664 this will take a very long time because i need think about there are a lot of performances um
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-43793-43905 um memorable
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-43937-44085 er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-44176-44697 i think last year we participated in this thing called acapellia art
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-44784-45094 acapella championships it's like a
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-45156-45737 er open thing ah there're different categories but basically anybody can join yah and
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-45755-46769 er we didn't train for very long we train for like less than two months i think but there was something special about that group yah and i
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-46772-47449 it was very thrilling but also very scary because there was choreography and if there's one thing i cannot do it's dance
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-48174-48381 ah okay yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-48391-48736 not dancing
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-48753-48853 er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-48856-49123 alright
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-49179-49405 er i like to read
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-49415-49922 yah i like to watch movies yah and
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-49939-50097 i like to spend time with my dog
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-50123-50265 yes i have a dog
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-50287-51366 okay so she's a west-highland-terrier which kinda looks like that er snowy from tin-tin yah but she's not very white she's very brown because she likes to play in the mud
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-51373-51644 yeah so she's er seven years old this year
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-51900-52646 er dog years so she's like middle aged she's like forty nine eh seven human years so for in dog years she's forty nine i think
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-52657-52762 yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-52987-53176 yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-54070-55237 er i like yoga i su se cause like i have anemia so that means if i do anything too quickly or too strenuously then i get dizzy
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-55240-55407 so i can't do much
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-55411-56502 but i do like to exercise i really enjoyed muay thai and b j j yah but just that the company in harmonics er is a lot more enjoyable so i picked
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-56507-56951 acapella singing over the other sports clubs in school yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-57466-58057 er yah also because er i think practices fall on the same day that's one thing
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-58074-58342 and another thing is er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-58348-58857 yah i re~ needed to juggle school work as well so to choose two out of three
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-59296-59648 is er grades er that's not something yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-60124-60328 oh my god er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-60441-60666 yah no actually no
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-60716-61051 it's probably sleep too much and then the other two suffer as a result
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-61359-61554 i know but what time do i wake up
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-61576-61824 yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-61829-61961 er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-61989-62820 er any time between seven to twelve eh er seven a m to twelve p m depending on whether i have class or not but yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-63225-64720 on weekends ah er oh cause uh actually i currently only have two days of school so i give tuition to this boy five times every other day that i don't have class so i on saturday and sunday at about eight a m i have tuition ah so i have to wake up early on weekends
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-64971-65080 yah correct
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-65173-65300 er english
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-65351-65519 er primary two
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-65534-65649 yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-65907-66604 so like he's from his family is from mainland-china they moved here a couple of years ago so er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-66607-67953 my job is to inculcate the interest in reading in him ah yah so uh i won't say it's it okay it's not easy but he's er it's really up to the students' like
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-67965-68607 attitude towards er receiving the learning and he's not bad like he's quite receptive and he's quite smart
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-68615-68809 but he's very lazy so
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-68844-69041 pros and cons yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-69379-69508 erm
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-69691-70232 for example he will complain like every time i ask him to do something he will complain but er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-70239-70342 i guess it's
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-70409-71463 a mixture of like letting him complain a bit because i mean you've been there before you understand how you don't want to do something but er also encouraging him
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-71466-72240 like especially when he gets something right like he respond very well to positive feedback yah so that's been helping
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-72681-73155 yes i am stereotypical literature student er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-73158-73353 job but yes yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-73576-73739 er as in
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-73977-74926 i i didn't want to teach literature so it would be j c but there's no demand for that currently so i su se primary school because i like working with kids
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-74943-75060 yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-75523-75638 er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-75885-76372 wow personal question er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-76375-76676 ideally i would think two
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-76682-77143 kids yeah one boy one girl ideally but you cannot control this kind of thing so
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-77152-77252 yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-77626-77991 no i have a younger sister yeah that's right
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-78155-78259 fantastic
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-78267-78377 yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-78419-79795 i didn't mean that sarcastically er in the past when we were growing up i think we fought a lot but after a certain point i think after we she entered junior college then we just became very close
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-79821-80514 yah so we share everything and we talk about everything ah yah i mean we still fight that's normal but yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-80698-81119 er she's actually in n t u as well she is er #wee-kim-wee# major
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-81325-81937 er does she sing no but she dances really well so the the one thing i cannot do she can do very well
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-82121-82765 i think i think so so actually is not fair she can do both probably but i can only do one
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-83484-84178 it it's been twenty four years and nothing has happened for me ah but i guess yah we shall see
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-84437-84731 oh my god okay yes me too
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-85539-85654 yes that's right
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-85774-86348 er yes i am this year actually but with a different group of people yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-86749-86933 oh er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-87006-87603 as in you want me to compare last year's group with this year's group or in general oh okay
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-88091-88267 oh er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-88303-89546 for one thing i mean personality to begin with is very important ah if you all don't click on a certain level then it's very hard to firstly find songs that you all wanna do together
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-89560-90789 uh because people have very different tastes and another thing is perhaps your working style is very different maybe some people are more systematic some people a little bit more unorthodox then if cannot work together then there are a lot of problems
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-91029-91144 er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-91176-91295 okay so
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-91312-91994 er when you learn scores or we learn when we learn songs you can choose to learn er via a score
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-92007-92917 and all the parts are nicely er written out for you or you could erm make your own arrangement which er requires er doing everything from scratch
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-92921-93350 or it could be taking a score and tweaking the score also so yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-93365-94303 uh that's one part when i mean unorthodox i mean it's not following a certain set of instructions and another thing is uh how people learn
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-94351-94560 yah so some people
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-94567-95418 er sit down and then they go through everything step by step but other people maybe er not consistent yah only
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-95659-95871 ah my brain hurts like
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-95931-96103 it's as and when basically
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-96108-96783 people work differently so i'm by unorthodox yah if you're not the usual kind of learner yah correct
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-96970-97082 er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-97129-97239 to be honest
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-97348-98154 i wanna say i am orthodox but i can't really read scores very well so i still need help from my teammates
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-98157-98420 but luckily they're all very talented so
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-98579-98697 ah thanks
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session1-2-99291-99561 thanks
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-01298-01519 ah okay um
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-01534-01793 er may i ask which part of the north spine you're at
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-02004-02231 oh mcdonald's okay so er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-02241-02573 what you want to do is er take
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-02687-04502 erm the red line er from #lee-wee-nam# library er to the closest bus stop to the hive which would be innovation-centre i believe so to get from mcdonald's to er the bus stop you have to
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-04725-07020 go pass this area it's a stage area and they're set of large brown steps it's called canopy-k i believe then er following that there should be a overhead bridge walkway er that connects the north spine to n i e so you take the first staircase that goes er down to your right and the bus stop should be there
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-07027-07666 yah you just wait for the red line i believe it's a one two three
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-07703-08946 four stops and then you just get off and you should be able to see the hive the hive with easily recognisable it looks like a set of chinese #dim-sum# er what do you call them
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-08971-09184 basket brown baskets yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-09422-09544 oh welcome
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-100653-101674 and er i find out that you didn't invite me so i would tell you why #bo# er #bojio# er why you #bojio# that means why did you not ask me to go with you
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-10187-10317 um hm
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-101883-103189 yah so #bo# if you split the word into two parts this #bo# and #jio# #jio# is to ask somebody to go out and then #bo# is er mean you didn't yah so put together it's you didn't ask me to go yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-103690-103898 oh yes you can uh it
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-103908-104391 can be for any activity yah not just to places yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-105151-105559 do not ask you why you wanted
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-105564-105966 why oh as in to do homework together erm
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-106014-106874 er i i su se so #bojio# can be used for like like i said any activity so yes i su se so yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-10610-11238 okay so the nearest m r t station er is called pioneer m r t and you have to take uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-107153-108221 but the it's kinda implies there's a accusation that that you didn't invite the person so i would think there is a negative connotation there to it yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-108746-109077 oh the merlion okay er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-109121-109238 kay so
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-109245-109636 do you know of the story of #sang-nila-utama#
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-109746-111120 kay so long story short it's this prince who came from somewhere and he landed on this island called #temasek# so basically he saw this magical creature eh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-111165-112008 eh wait no that's not right he saw a lion okay never mind come back i maybe if you go to uh sentosa have you been to sentosa
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-112036-112490 ah yes so have you seen this gigantic er statue of like erm
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-112544-112939 thing with a lion's head and the body of a fish
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-11257-14332 er one er service bus er one seven nine out of school er to get there and erm so you can head to that same bus stop i was telling you about earlier on but instead of taking the red line which only er goes around school er you take the bus that says one seven nine and if you are unsure of exactly where to get off at i would recommend asking the bus uncle er or auntie to er let you know when you have arrived at that bus stop yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-112990-114078 yes yes so that thing right erm it's uh so that's why it's called merlion it's literally mermaid i think plus lion so it's er al~ amalgamation of these two things it's
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-114095-114860 erm su sedly said to be singapore's er like a part of singapore's history or like it's literature is folklore
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-114864-115145 but really it's er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-115171-115649 iconic er because the singapore-tourism-board has made it so
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-115653-116572 yah it's actually a part of singapore's tourism yah like icon it's not really anything to do with history or folklore yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-116746-117175 uh no it's not like er yah you can't use it like that
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-117189-117893 but you can say have you actually wait you can use the word merlion i believe okay so if you notice right and if you n~ uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-117908-118226 that sentosa merlion is not the only place of a merlion
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-118241-118871 like i do believe clarke-quay has a merlion as well when there's a normally has a jet of water shooting out of its mouth
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-118889-119693 so when you say er merlion another way of er they could it could mean er that i'm saying that you're vomiting
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-119710-119891 yah so
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-120005-120290 no er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-120313-120903 i don't know how to use this word but i've heard other people use it in yah basically the idea is that you are
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-120928-121352 project you're projecting vomit yes that's right yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-121506-121740 yes yes same
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-15307-15441 okay so er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-15461-20734 buses that run within school er which would refer to the campus red line the campus blue line and er there are few other colours which i cannot remember green and yellow i think but those are free uh and there's another er f~ er service that runs out of school actually but it's er in a loop so it will drop you at er pioneer m r t which is that m r t you wanna go to and it will come back to school but that er loop which i think is called the what is it called um some green green line green rider i'm not sure school rider basically that bus er only stops at very specific bus stops and it's not convenient er considering you at mcdonald's for you to take that line so one seven nine will be faster but is one seven nine erm i believe the base price if you have student concession is seventy seven cents but it can go up to about maybe a dollar a dollar twenty yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-20885-20992 erm
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-21000-21427 student concession is something that uh all students in singapore have
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-21458-23705 er from the moment you are in primary school up till er university level so normally er let's say a bus ride were to cost you maybe eighty five cents er for a adult if you had a normal er e z-link card but if you had a student concession it might be a bit cheaper maybe seventy cents basically its cheaper yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-23936-24207 er for students or for adults
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-24347-24685 er it's er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-24694-25558 it's a transportation card that it's a card that stores money inside that you can use to pay when taking public transport yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-25854-26070 yes that teeteet noise yeah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-26372-27010 er you're currently a exchange student right so i believe you could try a ying for a
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-27050-28192 temporary student pass i am not sure that works or not but if that doesn't work then you just have to get a normal e z-link card which you can get from any uh m r t station i believe yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-29030-29222 dhoby-ghaut okay
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-29231-30164 er so you have to understand that there are a couple of different colored lines er on the singapore m r t and currently uh you are on the green line or the n~
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-30182-31645 east-west-line yes that's right so you're at pioneer you want to get to dhoby-ghaut which actually is in the middle of singapore kind of so you're gonna have to take er just a straight train all the way till er this stop called er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-31683-31855 raffles-place
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-31901-33285 er because i prefer that stop because it's less crowded than the next stop which is called city-hall yah so you take it to this uh m r t called raffles-place then you change from this green line to this other line which is the red line
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-33289-33422 or the north
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-33471-33797 south line and you just take i think
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-33799-34202 one two stops then you'll reach dhoby ghaut m r t
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-34483-35648 what is there at dhoby-ghaut erm well it's kind of at the tail end of orchard road so i su se if you want to go there to shop or to eat or to catch a movie
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-35655-35909 yah you could do those things there
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-36773-37551 landscapes uh then i would recommend going to maybe the botanical-gardens which is at
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-37602-38092 the m r t station called botanic-gardens yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-38302-38556 from pioneer okay so um
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-38602-38721 you would take
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-38736-40570 er from pioneer m r t you would drop off er you take it to buona-vista m r t and er from there you gonna change from that green line to this other line which is the yellow line or the circle circle-line yes and er you will take er how many stops one two three three stops to botanic-gardens yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-40893-43163 ah okay so when you so that uh all trains are at they stop at m r t platforms right so once you get off get on to the platform you have to exit uh that platform and possibly walk a certain distance to get to the other platform but there are a lot of uh clear directional signs as to how to get from one platform to another so i don't think you'll be confused yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-43463-43630 erm
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-43653-43935 i think oh for one thing it's er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-43976-44589 i think it's a national heritage site yah and it's er i mean singapore is known as what
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-44596-45074 garden city and if you want to go and see a lot of greenery and a lot of different kinds of
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-45086-45568 er interesting plants then botanic you should go there yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-45996-46602 oh i didn't think about that yah that's true okay so gardens-by-the-bay is at
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-46655-46815 i believe its at
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-46887-47552 the stop called near marina-bay which is the tail end of the north-south-line
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-47572-47804 so similarly you could take
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-47819-48191 from pioneer m r t till
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-48275-48416 er what do you call it
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-48467-48635 honestly i don't know hold on
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-48843-49191 probably would take to city-hall and then change
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-49200-50039 to the red eh no no you go back to that raffles-place m r t from just now and then you would change to the red light and just take it all the way till the end yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-50467-50757 okay so gardens-by-the-bay is a
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-50779-51826 most okay so there have a outdoor area and an indoor area but the indoor area for at gardens-by-the-bay er is filled with i think imported plants that you cannot find in singapore
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-51917-53116 so but it's air conditioned so if you are feeling hot you know maybe should go there but gar~ but er botanic-gardens is free why whereas i think gardens-by-the-bay you have to pay about twenty dollars to go inside
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-53639-53832 okay alright
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-54762-55010 um breakfast option er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-55047-55586 oh okay well i mean singapore has a lot of different uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-55619-56753 races and cultures right so it really depends on what you like erm for example maybe #dim-sum# might be an option that's er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-56857-56969 chinese
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-57283-57576 i won't call it proper food but it's like
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-57604-58241 small in portion so it's good for sharing or good for trying if you are not that hungry
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-58249-58894 or maybe er #roti-prata# would just like kind of like
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-58941-59277 pizza dough but without
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-59382-59545 toppings yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-59579-60004 yah but erm actually no they have toppings but it doesn't look like a pizza
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-60021-60665 yes but the it's kinda dough like yes er and er if not you could try
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-60667-61044 porridge i su se yah or
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-61087-61228 or
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-61233-61861 we do have er what do you call this western american breakfast as well i mean yah which is
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-61863-62392 like if you have you want your baked beans your bacon your scrambled egg they have all that
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-62407-63205 at like maybe mcdonald's mcdonald's breakfast yes which i quite like for their pancakes hotcakes yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-63372-63541 er sometimes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-63791-64112 er i usually don't eat breakfast
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-64125-65144 but if i do when i do eat breakfast it's normally bread er with something inside like a spread or cereal yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-66245-66406 oh right
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-66421-67893 okay very good thanks i forgot about that uh so that is also another popular eating uh eating breakfast breakfast option erm so basically you order toast and inside that toast they have but there is butter and this other thing called #kaya#
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-67945-69613 honestly i don't know how to describe #kaya# to you but it's sweet and it's quite smooth normally yah and it goes well with the butter and the toast and erm so normally this toast would come with er like you said the plate with two eggs right so those are er soft boiled eggs
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-69645-70550 soft boiled eggs yes yah and then you just crack them open and then you typically mix it with a little bit of black sauce and pepper to taste
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-70563-71509 and yah that plus the eggs plus the toasts plus probably a cup of coffee or tea would be a pretty normal breakfast
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-71740-72187 oh it really depends on where you go but i think the cheapest i've had it is
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-72219-72468 two fifty two dollars
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-72488-72603 yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-72686-72802 correct yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-73684-73841 yes yes
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-73868-74042 what do i eat uh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-74127-74888 oh depends er in school like options are quite limited yah so um i normally eat uh this thing called
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-75016-75362 okay the chinese term is #cai-fan# but
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-75378-77270 this english term which i dont really like called economical rice it's called economical rice i believe because it's not it's su sed to cost you less lah har not su sed to be expensive like yah cause you get to choose between a lot of different options meats er vegetables yah and you can pick whether you want rice or noodles <c\/> yah
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-77298-78352 um if it's not there then it's normally i order from the japanese store in the canteen near my school building yes i love japanese food
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-78371-78854 it's actually you can get any kind of cuisine in singapore it really depends on what you want to eat
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-79341-79756 i don't know what african cuisine is could you tell me what
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-80192-80293 uh huh
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-80347-80454 chicken-rice
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-80511-80736 uh what is chicken-rice erm
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-80826-81802 chicken-rice is self explanatory but basically it's chicken like chop chicken you have a choice between er white chicken and er
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-81851-83719 and i want to say braised no roasted chicken there we go roasted chicken that one is the brown color skin one the one with brown color skin yah if not then in it's white skin uh and then yah normally chicken-rice comes with er what's so special about chicken-rice is the rice is not normal rice yah it's fragrant
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-83743-83888 with something
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-83897-84168 cocon~ no it's not coconut that is #nasi lemak#
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-84171-84342 right okay
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-84345-85049 but yes chicken-rice is pretty good but if you want rice but without chicken i would recommend #nasi-lemak#
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-85053-85634 yes so it's a oh chicken rice like typically belong it's like a
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-85696-86047 chinese thing er #nasi-lemak# is more
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-86053-87541 a malay thing i want to say yes right er and erm yah so instead of the chicken what you have is like typically a piece of fried chicken or a piece of fried fish along with a tiny

S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-98929-99497 okay let me give you an example sentence and then i try and explain it to you okay so erm
S1-mml-5-april-2018-session3-2-99499-100643 let's say you went out with a bunch of friends and they were we're good friends right but you went out with a bunch of other friends uh to do something that i enjoyed maybe you were went to uh eat at my favourite restaurant
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-01082-01232 my name is #guan-yu#
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-01301-01426 and uh
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-01453-01599 oh what what do you want
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-01688-02489 oh okay uh i'm in year two i'm studying renaissance-engineering programme i'm specialising in civil-engineering and yah
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-02723-05910 er okay basically my course is a double degree sort of like a double degree programme so where the in the first year the students are exposed to erm broad based engineering and then the second year onwards right we will uh specialise in one engineering course of our choice and then in the f~ third year we'll be going for an exchange then then four year we come back uh halfway through the fourth year we'll be taking our masters yah so the masters is like some masters in information i i don't really know what the masters is actually yah yah but it's a four and a half year course
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-05914-06032 yah
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-06252-06550 uh yah in the first year it was definitely quite
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-06587-09848 crazy for me i feel like the the change from a levels to uni cause everybody told me that uni was gonna be like easy when i spoke to my seniors lah like easier than a-levels ah not not okay yah but then i didn't feel that way yah every day was just like a mad rush and during finals period was just like wah intense but in the second year is much better cause okay in the first year we had every sem we took six finals and then uh in the second year we took er we er like for example this sem we only took three finals so it was like a lot more time yah a lot better
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-09853-10325 yah so right now it's not that bad but looking back it was like quite crazy ah yah
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-101755-101939 yah i don't think it's inside um
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-102457-103138 oh no no no er for me i like i try to hit the hundred and sixty grams but like in school okay cause i i'm too lazy to cook
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-103155-103492 yah so like what i do is i okay i drink one carton of milk every day
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-103507-107500 yah then no ah but it's like er skimmed milk so it's like okay yah it's not that it's not that fat fat milk then er i take two scoops of protein powder then i eat like uh there's this bread called smart-carb it's like the best bread for body builders in singapore lah so i take like two slices of that then that's like that would constitute about like hundred grams of my protein every single day then er usually i will go out like when i go for classes and stuff like that i will i will buy like uh i will choose to get more protein orh like more eggs ah more chicken and then i'll get the remaining like fifty to sixty grams from there lah yah i don't cook my own prepare my own meals ah uh unless it's like a long holiday or what then i have time then i can prepare but if in the if it's in the school term i don't i won't have the time yah
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-10476-10720 um i just ended yesterday yah
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-10758-11011 uh quite easy lah i would say yah
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-108171-108500 uh okay uh i don't do anything like really
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-108503-109668 as much as i do power lifting already lah but then er sometimes you main mainly basketball lah but it's like recreational recreational games recreational fun yah with friends and stuff like that not yah um
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-110181-110618 nah no lah it really depends on how you okay like
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-11028-11134 yah
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-110626-113524 how an athlete wants to develop himself right it depe~ it really depends on himself like er so you see a lot of the body builders like those very massive guys right they are actually okay er like okay this is not to like generalize all of them lah but actually a few of them are actually like very they are unfit like even though they may look very fit but they just have the looks they don't have the they don't have the like the athletic capabilities as like maybe like a small person who have now why why do i say that because bodybuilding right if you do not
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-113532-113698 er do it properly like
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-113711-116673 there are there like um if you don't want do it properly you can actually like it's quite harmful to the body lah i feel like for example erm how would i say that like okay because like the traditional way of bodybuilding right is that you get big so that's called bulking season then you so like that's the season where all the bodies will like try to eat a lot and they will try to become very massive lah to get a lot of mass muscle mass so at that season they get really very fat they can their body fat can go to twenty five those kind of percent range so it's actually very high
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-11494-11677 yah yah
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-116673-118011 then after they reach the percent range right then they will cut down so they will have this cutting season like before the competition so you learn then the cutting season right basically that's where your clean eating comes in you eat chicken breast uh your healthy eating ah so
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-118045-121249 then that's where you try to cut away all the fat that you have gained during the bulking season but you try to retain the muscle mass so your body becomes like lean and like it looks very good before for the competition but then if you were to realise this kind of lifestyle is not very good what like it's just cycling yourself to like a lot of food and then like healthy thing for one period and then when you are going to the bulking season like it's quite crazy you can eat anything you want yah can eat like all the protein ah but that is the traditional way but like for modern more modern like body builders right they are doing like this thing called a lean lean bulk basic means which basically mean right like
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-121261-123735 as you are progressing like after your completion right you don't go like ape shit crazy and just eat all the food that you want to eat but you control yourself and like you just eat like erm you eat moderately like bulk while still allowing your body to grow but you do not let your yourself to get like balloon to like that kind of fat level yah so that it's it's actually like i feel that is healthy yah because you are not like going crazy and eating anything you want so actually
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-12321-14429 oh er okay i like to play i like to do all kinds of sports stuff lah last time i used to play basketball competitively but then i stopped when i went to the army and i didn't really pick it up after i come to uni so now i like to do is i like to do power lifting so basically if you don't know it's just like er going to the gym and performing three exercises yah squat bench and dead lift
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-123748-124701 bodybuilding like er it's not a very healthy sport lah but then stamina wise i wouldn't say like if you were to like a normal person going to the gym i won't say it will like er
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-124709-126941 decrease your stamina and or whatever it's bec~ unless you are you're saying like if you go to gym then you stop like running or stuff like that because like uh stamina this kind of stuff comes from like er aerobic activities ah like er running jogging swimming those kind of stuff then if you stop doing those kind of activities then definitely your stamina will get worse lah or your speed will not be as far <unk> will not be as fast or stuff like that but going to the gym alone i don't think it will like
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-126947-127074 harm anything
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-127083-127743 yah unless you taking it too drastically or whatever then if not i won't think it it has like that big of a side effect
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-127747-127876 yah
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-128115-128244 okay
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-14441-15472 yah so uh then you just try to get your numbers higher and higher every every like time you go there so that's like what i'm interested in now yah that's my hobby um
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-15847-18143 oh self train lah i don't have money to follow a coach actually is not really important to like i mean okay not say not important but like i mean if you research enough you read enough you can actually do a lot of things yourself and like self learn ah so that's why i a y lor to my training yah and i have friends around me lah who like who are a lot more experienced than me and who coach me along the way yah but i don't have like a formal coach or what yah
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-18956-20162 oh yah no problem so naming out ah er okay so basically there are like a set of rules that you need to comply to when you are in a competition so for example like the for the squat ah you need to squat like into a certain depth
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-20187-20685 such a~ like your hips are below parallel for it to be considered like a deep enough squat
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-20690-24726 those kind of stuff lah so uh basically this kind of exercises it's not really like testing like okay like bodybuilding is like going for aesthetics and stuff like that but then for a power lifting it's er more complicated than that it's not just like how you look or how much muscle mass you have but it's really like how you can it like utilize your muscle fibers so there's uh apart from like having muscle right you need to be able to use the muscle groups like the muscle fibers that you have so a lot of the body builders you see when they go to the gym they become very big then they are had they have a very large mass of muscle lah but then like because they don't have a specific training to teach them how to like utilize the muscle fibres
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-24745-25381 to the maximum potential so you see a lot of them actually not very strong like relative to the size that they have
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-25394-26610 but for power lifting you focus on strength so even a smallest of guys they can lift like the heaviest of weights so it's really about training your central nervous system to perform to a peak like to come to peak performance every time it could
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-26618-26854 every time you're trying to perform the maximum lift
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-26889-27135 yah something like that
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-27158-27330 yah it's quite
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-28231-29088 uh okay like i mean people don't really discuss power lifting in terms of static and dynamic forces because it's very like technical lah and i don't think everybody has the
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-29093-30281 like not everybody doing power lifting has the knowledge to discuss that but then i mean i mean it's definitely involve in er in one way or another lah like although it's not really discussed but um
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-30316-34027 power lifting is more like a static force i would say because the range of motion and everything you are doing right is like you are doing in one single plane yah like for example the squat you take out the you er after you unwrap the bar right you are just in like one single plane and when you squat you are in a single plane so it's always like a dynamic movement but then you're actually being in er the position doesn't really change and the force when you are generating the maximum amount of force right it's when you are in a stationary position at the lowest point of your squat so like after you squat down you want to stand up again right but then you have a lot of weight on your back so that is the point right like static point where you actually need to generate the most amount of force to bring your body up so
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-34062-34249 um like
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-34277-35574 on when you go online and read stuff like that they don't really talk about forces lah i mean like cause not everybody would be able to understand it but then when you read right like you can corelate it to what you have learnt in school like man made forces and stuff like that yah so definitely a icable um
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-35934-36348 uh for my squat i have squatted two hundred k g before
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-36359-36706 dead lift i have dead lifted two hundred and twenty k g before
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-36710-37004 and bench i have benched hundred and twenty k g before
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-37364-37472 um
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-37673-37930 uh okay uh like cause i just started like
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-37935-40047 uh maybe like i have trained i've been trained for like one year yah so it's like not a long period of time okay so the thing with power lifting is that right like from a lot of sports right as athletes grow older they actually decline in performance lah so when let's say uh for if you're twenty one right you reach thirty years old right you would expect to peak around like maybe twenty five and then like erm
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-40059-41229 okay lah maybe not so young lah but then for power lifting is different it's like as you grow older right like um miraculously you just become better in some in one way or another cause like a lot of the strongest power lifters right they are actually like thirty plus
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-41233-42941 years old yah so er given my short training experience i'm quite happy with my results actually yah but definitely nowhere near any benchmarks or what lah it's just a personal thing i set for myself yah i haven't really competed before also i just do it for like fun and because it's quite
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-42962-43280 like relaxing every time you go to the gym like as in
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-43283-45928 let's let's say i have a school day right then you have a very stressful day then you go to the gym you have like two hours of time where you can just like lift and then when you are doing that heavy weights right you cannot think of anything else because you cannot let anything affect your like um like the they call it the mind muscle connection ah basically you want your body to be prime when you are doing the lift so if you think about anything else it's gonna affect it lor so it's a way for me to distress ah yah um
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-46323-50196 um oh okay like the most important thing is to train safely like in the in the past when i start training i definitely did not like er did not understand that because i just wanted to get stronger everyday lah i wanted to lift more everyday but then i realised that like erm my it was quite reckless like the the way i was training in the past like i can go like i can go all out then have very little rest those kind of stuff and i didn't really like note er take note of my form so form basically is like the way you conduct an exercise lah so you have erm when you're doing very heavy exercise like er you need you want to make sure that your body is safe mah so that's like where the form comes in if you don't train safely then your body will
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-50205-53835 like it have a higher tendency to get injured lah so er in the the most important thing is to train safe i would say like in the past i got injured quite a few times and like whenever you get injured you get stalled maybe you you like injured like for one month you can't train f~ can cannot train for one month then when you come back you will you know you will not only lose the one month's time but then your results will roll back because you don't actually conduct the lift mah so you don't have the yah so you need to get it back the muscle memory so you will take more time so most important thing is to train safely yah focus on form and like just have fun orh when you're doing it yah that's the best way to like get better as anything i feel
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-54130-54636 uh badly not not badly lah but then like definitely have injuries like they will
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-54642-56907 oh they will always like come and go one it just depends on how you like deal with it so like er minor injuries lor like maybe like the wrist er then sometimes like the back the back is the like one of the like quite of a f~ soft spot lah yah even sometimes now i still have like strains here and there then whenever there's strain you need to like take it slow easy for a while yah but no no like significant major injuries
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-57794-62266 oh okay er so um one thing is do not ego lift 'ah ego lifting basically means like you know you try to lift more than your body can actually handle yah so uh you ju~ you want make sure that you progress you know you are progressing at a rate which you are comfortable with your comf~ your body is comfortable with then uh the then the form is also very important because like the way you the way you go down into a squat the way your back is like er like how is it straighten or not straighten or is it like er wobbly your body is wobbly or stuff like that your knees are caving in and stuff like that these are like indicators that your form is not good or your like maybe like a muscle part is lagging so you need to like actually bring like strengthen the muscle group so that you actually become stronger and you don't actually commit the you know like
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-62273-65612 commit the exercise in a er negative way ah yah so then oh also take take you need to take a lot of rest because like um like er they chinese they always say that #xiuxi shi wei le zou gen chang yuan de lu# lah which means like er yah resting go walk along the way but um yah it's actually very true because like um like what i realized right from what i realized if last in the past like when i started training right i actually train everyday like seven days a week yah so like every every session was like two three hours cause it was after army i had a lot of time ah yah so and then
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-65642-65984 like i didn't really get injured at that time ah but then er like
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-65987-66595 every time i went to a gym i just sweat a lot but i didn't really see myself like improving yah so uh
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-66617-67746 how to say ah like you need to r~ like but then after i went to uni right then i didn't have that much time to like actually go to the gym at like so i cut my sessions down maybe like four five times a week and i actually saw my strength improve quite a bit
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-67750-68281 because er like i had er more rest lah like yah then er
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-68304-71490 actually that's like in intuitive because when you're exercising you need your muscles you need to give time for your muscles to rest mah because when you're going to the gym you're actually breaking down the muscle fibers then you need to let them have the time to recuperate if not if like let's say you break the muscle fibers the next day they are not even recovered you go and hit them again right they will just become like more and more broken yah you need to allow time for them to heal lah so more rest lor to like prevent injuries and stuff like that yah it's actually quite important ah and the diet is also quite important yah get enough food enough protein and then er get enough sleep yah then everything should be should come in place ah um
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-72038-72902 yah i take er two su ements actually i take protein whey-protein and er creatine yah just these two um
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-72976-73129 why do i take
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-73200-73657 oh er okay so whey-protein is the one that like many
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-73660-76474 people go to the gym use to like if you wanna build muscle lah it's like the go to su ement it's the one everybody will start out with so um yah er okay whey-protein basically when you're trying to like gain strength or gain mussle right you need to hit a nu~ certain amount of protein yah so it's er in your diet and the protein right is actually quite high like er con~ contrary to what other people like to believe and so i've done like some calculations for on my own and i reali~ er okay my body weight is like hundred and sixty pounds so
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-76507-76823 um by right right they say you need to get like one
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-76825-77966 er one gram to two grams of protein per pound of body weight so like for if the m~ like if i consider the minimum amount of protein i need right that's hundred and sixty grams of protein which i need every day
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-77973-80194 yah and like if i think that that's like quite quite little like even it might sound quite little but then it's actually quite insane like let me like okay let let me explain to you like how much it's like in one one hundred and sixty grams of protein so like hundred and sixty grams of protein right so er one carton of milk is usually like thirty eight forty grams of protein ah i say forty grams then one scoop of protein powder is usually like twenty five grams of protein
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-80209-83257 then one chicken breast er is twenty five grams of protein so you imagine the amount that you have to eat every single day right it to keep the hundred and sixty grams it's actually quite it's usually quite a lot and for like competitive body builders like those who actually called like do it for a living one right they have to hit like er one point five times or to two grams of their body weight so that will be like okay like if they were like my my weight er my weight class but then uh most probably they will be like a lot heavier than me because they will be like hea~ they'll be like bigger and s~ stuff like that then they will need to have like four hundred <unk> four hundred and fifty grams of protein
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-83260-83555 <unk> yah so there's like erm
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-83561-83907 i can't really math that well but eighteen chicken breast yah
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-83940-84138 eighteen chicken breast yah
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-84153-84356 eighteen chicken breast every single day
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-84416-84569 yah yah like
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-84603-86236 so like those kind of like that's the kind of intensity that they go to orh yah and it's not like it's not like when you are off season ah like let's say when you after compete your you rest right you can you can stop eating er like eating the high amount protein actually when you're resting right you get you need to get more protein because like erm
S1-mml-5-dec-2017-session1-2-86241-89028 you want to you want to prevent your muscles from breaking down you know yah so you want to have you need still need to have the amount of protein yah so it's like a lifestyle lah i would say that's why i think like bodybuilding is not for everyone you know because not everyone can keep up with this kind of lifestyle healthy eating dieting and like going to the gym every day you know a lot of people like to go to the gym lah but when it comes to the diet part right wah it's like not for everyone already yah that's why it's not it's not a sport for everyone ah yah but it's a fun thing to do ah
